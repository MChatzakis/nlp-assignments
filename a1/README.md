#  Assignment 1 - Language model foundations ðŸ’¬

Welcome to the **1st assignment** for the **CS-552: Modern NLP course**!

## How to implement this assignment

Please read carefully the following points. All the information on how to read, implement and submit your assignment is explained in detail below.

1. For this assignment, you will need to implement and fill in the missing code snippets for both the **Jupyter Notebook** `assignment1.ipynb` and the **`utils.py`** python file. In the `utils.py` file, you will add all the Dataset and Model classes you will implement according to the skeleton present in the file. In the notebook, you will add the data preprocessing pipeline for all the datasets, the training and testing pipelines of all implemented models and the report (See diagram below).

2. To implement your coding part, you can import the external libraries we provide in the `requirements.txt` file, however, you should not use any other package non included in these requirements. 

3. At the end of the notebook, you will need to fill in a **report** template, providing the results of your implementation. We provide you with the template for the report, therefore you need to fill in the missing Markdown cells with the requested information. 

4. Along with the `assignment1.ipynb` and the `utils.py` files, you need to additionally upload models' pickle files under the `models/` dir, regarding the following models:
    - the three LSTM-variant models (PART 2)  
    - the trained-from-scratch Transformer model (PART 2) 
    - the fine-tuned Encoder-Decoder model (PART 3) 
    - the fine-tuned pre-trained Transformer model (PART 3)
    
You will provide test results on all of the model variants according to the report template.
    
5. Finally, you will need to log your training pipelines using Tensorboard. Please follow the instructions in the `README.md` of the [tensorboard/](tensorboard/README.md) directory.
