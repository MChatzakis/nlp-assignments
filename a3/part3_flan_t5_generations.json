A BBC investigation revealed that in Devon and Cornwall police have seen a 55% rise in reports of sexual abuse in the past four years. Police urged victims to come forward and said they would be protected. Updates on this story and more from Devon and Cornwall Between January and November 2015, 1,326 reports of sexual abuse were made to the force, compared with 853 in 2011. The figures show more than 380 historic allegations - in which the offence was committed before 1 May 2004 - of rape involving a child have been reported to the force since 2011. Jon Brown, head of development and impact at the NSPCC, said: \"Unfortunately there is a significant gap between the number of people who need help and therapy as a result of the abuse, and the availability of services.\" He said the rise in reports was a result of historic cases of child sex abuse in the news, which had encouraged more people to come forward. 853 - 2011 888 - 2012 979 - 2013 1,221 - 2014 1,326 - 2015 Mr Brown said the prime minister had highlighted child sexual abuse as a priority along with dealing with terrorism which was \"encouraging\". However, Mr Brown said there needed to be a \"more joined up approach [between authorities] to provide the provision of help for victims\" including \"greater treatment and help\" and working with schools and families to prevent abuse. He said local authorities, health services and the police, as well as charities such as the NSPCC, had a duty to protect and care for victims. Tom Dingwall, chief executive of Twelves Company, which supports sexual and domestic abuse victims in the South West, said it provided services to almost 300 victims in 2015. \"Last year, demand outstripped our capacity to deliver services and we turned away 112 adults from receiving specialist support.\" Across Devon and Cornwall there are four Local Safeguarding Children's Boards - which aim to protect those at risk. Andy Bickley, chair for Plymouth, said investments, including training courses for those who come into contact with children, have been made. David Taylor, the chair for Devon and Torbay, said authorities were \"getting better at identifying abuse\". He said: \"It is an extremely complex and challenging area of work, and authorities in the region are learning from best practice in other parts of the country.\" Source: Devon and Cornwall Police Det Ch Insp Neil Ralph said the rise in reports of abuse was a \"challenge for the police service, locally and nationally\", but the force had made a \"huge investment\" by creating a dedicated unit and was working with other forces. \"It is a large increase and we've increased our digital and online footprint as these things can be really difficult to report over the phone so it enables them to report abuse [online] much easier. \"People have a high level of trust in the police and the Operation Yewtree impact [means] they have felt more compelled to report abuse to police. He said a high number of the reports, which were released in response to a freedom of information request by BBC News, related to historical crimes and the force \"would do everything it can to investigate them and bring the offenders to justice\". - Local authorities have the statutory responsibility for safeguarding children. - The safeguarding is overseen by Local Safeguarding Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Boards. - These Boards are made up of a number of agencies such as local authorities, police, education & health providers. - Police will lead on criminal investigations with social care services leading on the safeguarding.",

Mr Hassan has now spent three years assigned to the lifeguard unit that patrols the beach. At high tide on a recent Friday afternoon, thousands of mostly young Somalis were playing in the surf - a scene of cheerful relaxation that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago in a city notorious for its decades of anarchy, famine and violence. \"This place is bangin'! Beautiful!\" said an exuberant 21-year-old named Hassan Mohammed. Like many others at the shore, he was from the diaspora and spoke English in a broad London accent. \"Never been here before. Very nice country. I'm born and raised in Europe. I thought it would be like seeing the end of the world. But it's improved very much,\" he said. Several restaurants have opened up at Lido beach, their shaded tables packed with Mogadishu's wealthier elites. \"Octopus, sea turtle, lobster, shrimp - it's all over this place! Somalia is the most rich in seafood,\" said Lule Dhan, an Ethiopian who is executive chef at the Benadir Beach Restaurant. \"This fabulous city... is not what the media portrays,\" he declared. \"Absolutely, I'm here to stay,\" said the restaurant's slightly less effusive co-owner, Abdi Resak Jamcale, who has returned to Somalia after two decades in California. \"I'm not making a profit but I'm breaking even. We need new laws to have more foreign investment here. For years people here never knew what's wrong and what's right - whoever has the gun [was in control]. But we're getting there, slowly,\" he said.

But if Lido beach is a clear indication of the growing sense of optimism in Mogadishu, this is not a city in which one can, or should, drop one's guard for long. Later in the afternoon, the local district police chief arrived and demanded that we leave the beach immediately, hinting darkly that our film crew might be working on behalf of al-Shabab. To reinforce his point, he was brandishing a grenade with some enthusiasm. Further down the beach, Hassan Mohammed - the young visitor from London - also began sounding slightly less emphatic about the city's charms when I asked him if he had any concerns about security, and al-Shabab. \"No. No. You talk about that and they'll come to you! You don't talk about that - not even a little bit. I'm scared of that. This country's un-trustable, the people are un-trustable. They're just like you but then they've got this different mentality. \"There's only certain people that you can trust but that's cos they're your family.

They work unpaid in offices opposite the looming Victorian hulk of their old employer. Val used to run the prison print shop with \"the same faces\" turning up time after time and would ask why they had come back into prison. They would explain how they could not get a job, often sending hundreds of applications and getting nowhere, so, as a result, they had turned back to crime. Paul is one of their success stories. After serving nearly nine years in prison, he struggled to find employment. His probation officer suggested he talk to the pair and for the last six months he has been employed by Winder Power, a manufacturer in West Yorkshire. \"They brought me here, got me an interview, got me through the door,\" he said. \"They gave me a chance.\" Steve acknowledged employers were wary of ex-offenders at the start and has found small and medium-sized businesses easier to engage. He takes the boss of each company into the prison and shows them the prisoners hard at work, as \"human beings\". Steve and Val then pre-interview candidates, ensuring they are prepared to do any job, even sweeping the floors as a start. Then they ask the company to give them an interview and treat them like any other applicant. Crucially, they offer support to both employer and employee for 12 months. \"We're there all the time for them,\" said Val, who told me that it can be difficult for ex-offenders, or \"graduates\" as they call them, to \"settle into ordinary employment\". \"The slightest thing can send them off track, so we're there at the end of the phone just to pick them back up so they can keep their jobs,\" he explained. \"The savings are staggering,\" Val said. \"The first 54 guys that we placed into work had between them 838 convictions, which shows you we don't cherry-pick.\" Prisoners with multiple convictions are often hardest to place, but so far the overwhelming majority have kept their jobs. Deteriorating conditions in prisons have encouraged some repeat offenders to try much harder to find work, according to Val and Steve. One man told them: \"I don't really want to go back to prison. It's changed a lot recently.\" Both men say there are not enough staff to deal with problems of violence and legal highs. However, Justice Secretary Liz Truss hopes to address that by announcing the recruitment of 2,100 extra prison officers in England and Wales, in addition to the 400 recently promised. She is planning measures to tackle drug smuggling into jails and to target reoffending rates. More than 100,000 crimes are committed annually by former prisoners. Ms Truss wants to see people improve their education and skills in prisons, so they are more likely to find work. Many ex-offenders find it very difficult to get a job, regardless of their qualifications. Steve told me that throughout his career prison \"was always quite a safe, not overly violent environment. But over the last two, three years, that's changed in many prisons\". Tempus Novo is now working in several prisons. Steve and Val believe their approach could help ex-offenders across the country. \"It would be an incredible win for society,\" said Steve. \"Less crime, less victims, and a huge saving to the taxpayer.\"",

Mrs Lewis said: \"Our family had just 20 years with Sean. It has taken us another 21 to secure the thorough, independent inquiry we should have seen immediately after his death.\" \"For two decades, our family has been tormented by questions about what Sean went through at Deepcut,\" she added. \"If his death had been properly investigated in 1995, we would have been spared years of uncertainty and pain. \"It should be a source of huge shame to the Ministry of Defence and Surrey Police that our mother had to fight for so long - far longer than she should have had to - to force the authorities to answer basic questions.\" The family said the original inquest took less than two hours and heard from six people. A criminal investigation seven years later found no evidence of third party involvement. Pte Benton's medical records were not obtained and no evidence was gathered or presented about his experiences at the base. The family, who are represented by human rights group Liberty, believe he was subjected to severe bullying. In a statement, the MoD said: \"The Armed Forces will not tolerate abuse, bullying, or discrimination. All allegations are taken very seriously and will be thoroughly investigated, either by the civil or military police and, where appropriate, action will be taken.\" \"It would be inappropriate to comment further while legal proceedings are ongoing -  we will assist the coroner as necessary,\" it added.

In the men's team pursuit, GB were beaten to the bronze medal by Italy. Media playback is not supported on this device \"I am really happy to come away with a medal, finally,\" Latham told the BBC. \"I wasn't sure that Teklinski was going to hold on there. \"I was in a decent position most of the time. I followed the Irish rider Felix English and I had a good lead out.\" Elsewhere Britain's sole rider in the men's keirin, Joe Truman, was outclassed in his semi-final, having tried to take the race out with two laps to go. And in the women's team pursuit, GB finished fifth in the heats and failed to make the bronze-medal ride. Olympic gold medallist Chris Boardman \"Latham had a fantastic final charge. He timed his effort well there. \"We hardly saw him in the race, he monitored things but that's why. He was waiting for that final sprint. And what a ride that was for him. \"But with three laps to go, I would not have said that Teklinski would make it, but he found something from somewhere to just hang on there. \"More than 2km out, he effectively started to sprint. It will take him some time to recover from that.\" Six-time Olympic gold medallist Sir Chris Hoy \"I don't think that would be expected. It's the kind of event you can never be super-confident of winning or winning a medal in. \"But if you ride sensibly, which he did, he positioned himself very well and didn't waste any energy in the first part of the race. \"He marked the danger men and clearly had the legs for the sprint at the end. That's fantastic, a really great result for him and the team.\" Team pursuit Olympic gold medallist Elinor Barker came into the quartet of Emily Nelson, Manon Lloyd and Ellie Dickinson. The young squad were unable to compete for a medal but Barker remained positive about their progress. She told the BBC: \"It's the first Worlds for all of these girls and it's made it a lot more exciting. \"The level is so high already physically and technically. We have so much scope for improvement. It's such a good place to be in. \"Four years until Tokyo and we've just come fifth at the Worlds.\" Double Olympic gold medallist Joanna Rowsell Shand said on BBC TV: \"Coming into the competition, I don't think anyone expected them to medal. \"Until Elinor Barker joined the team today, we had four brand new riders. With an average age of 19, they've all got bright futures ahead of them.\" Earlier in the day, Olympic bronze medallist Katy Marchant was eliminated from the women's sprint in the first round. The 24-year-old, who claimed bronze behind Kristina Vogel of Germany and fellow Briton Becky James at Rio 2016, was the only female sprinter to travel to Hong Kong.

It is these two subjects that spark animated discussions and get the juices flowing. Even though in football, we have not won anything on the continental or world stage for a very long time, we still believe that the Black Stars, our national team, are special. One of the inner sources of the strength that help Ghanaians survive is the fact that our national team regularly beats the national team of the United States at football. Trying to get a visa from Ghana to the United States is one of the most humiliating experiences for Ghanaians. But we are able to endure it all by simply repeating over and over again under our breaths: \"World Cup 2006, we defeated you, World Cup 2010, we defeated you.\" Now, we discovered quite unexpectedly that defeating the US at football has even deeper implications, when news broke that our government had accepted two Yemeni ex-detainees, Khalid al-Dhuby and Mahmoud Omar Bin Atef, from Guantanamo Bay, where the US detains terror suspects, to live in Ghana. Elizabeth Ohene: \"They are excited to come to Ghana because of Asamoah Gyan, the captain of the Black Star - they know him and they like him very much\" The government has struggled to explain this decision. We have been told the two men pose no danger whatsoever to Ghana; they were innocent 20-year-olds when they were arrested and to drive home their innocence, our president compares them to his own 20-year-old son. We have been told that even though the two men are such thoroughly harmless and nice people, their every move will be monitored. Normally taciturn officials from the US embassy are suddenly all over the radio and television trying to assure us we should all be proud of our government for bringing to Ghana men the US Senate deems too dangerous to enter their country. When none of these interventions appeared to be calming the protests, the two thoroughly harmless and nice men were brought out to state their own case on national radio. Guantanamo Bay prison: The pair said they do not belong to any terrorist group, and have been wrongly arrested for 14 years without any charge. They have suffered but are not looking for revenge. They want to live in Ghana quietly and peacefully, and put their lives together. All that did not sound very convincing to any of us here; what everybody really wanted to know was why they had been brought to Ghana - did they just pick us on the map because Ghana happens to be the physical centre of the world? And suddenly it all comes tumbling out. They are excited to come to Ghana because of Asamoah Gyan, the captain of the Black Stars, they know him and they like him very much. A lot of the detainees like Ghanaians very much, and during the 2010 World Cup, most of the people there in Guantanamo Bay - no, not most of them, all of them -  were with Ghana and when the Black Stars beat America, they were very happy. So now we know... beating America at football has consequences. I am afraid I don't know what happened to our secret supporters in Guantanamo in 2014. They obviously did not cheer loud enough that year, which must be why we lost to the US. And for that reason alone, I think our two long-term visitors should be sent back to reorganize our supporters club in Guantanamo. More from Elizabeth Ohene:",

Mr Cunha was for many years one of Brazil's most powerful politicians. He led the impeachment process against President Dilma Rousseff, who was dismissed in August. Mr Cunha, from the centre-right PMDB party, was expelled from the Brazilian Congress last month. He was arrested in the capital, Brasilia, and has been transferred to the southern city of Curitiba, where federal judge Sergio Moro is leading the corruption probe. Mr Moro said he had ordered the arrest because there was \"a real possibility of [Mr Cunha] fleeing the country as he has resources hidden abroad\". The fact that he has dual Brazilian and Italian citizenship also increased the risk of him trying to evade justice, added Mr Moro. Mr Cunha has been detained for an indeterminate period. Petrobras is at the centre of a massive kickbacks scandal which cost the company $2bn (\u00c2\u00a31.5bn) and has led to the arrest of dozens of lawmakers and top businessmen. At least three businessmen have said under interrogation that they paid bribes to Mr Cunha, which they deposited in his overseas accounts. Along with his seat he has lost the partial immunity from prosecution that comes with being an elected representative. In March 2015 Mr Cunha stated that he did not have \"any type of account anywhere that is not declared on my income tax\".

Tamboran Resources wanted to drill a 750m deep hole at a quarry at Belcoo, using permitted development rights. It issued a statement saying it was \"deeply concerned\" by the minister's decision. By John CampbellBBC News NI Economics & Business Editor Tamboran had intended to drill using \"permitted development rights\", which meant the firm would not have needed to apply for planning permission. The minister could only veto this if he assessed that work was likely to have \"a significant environmental impact\". And that is exactly the position he has arrived at. Tamboran will now have to make a full planning application with an accompanying environmental statement, a process that will, conservatively, take months to complete. But it does not mean the borehole will not eventually be drilled. Alternatively, Tamboran may want to try to get a judicial review of the  decision, arguing that the minister has not interpreted the planning regulations correctly. \"The company is currently reviewing its position and will release a further statement in due course,\" Tamboran said. Tamboran will now have to make a full planning application with an accompanying environmental statement. On Monday night, protesters held an ecumenical service at the gates of the quarry to celebrate the minister's decision. Donal O'Cofaigh from Belcoo Frack Free welcomed the decision and said it could delay the project considerably. \"It's a great relief, the minister has made the right decision,\" he told the BBC. \"This is the first time that we are going to have the opportunity to be consulted on that. This is something that is of grave concern to the local community.\" The MP for the area, Michelle Gildernew of Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in, also welcomed the announcement. \"The decision to deny Tamboran to begin deep bore test drilling in Belcoo, Fermanagh, is the correct decision given the clear opposition to fracking in the area,\" she said. Tamboran staff moved into the quarry three weeks ago and carried out work to secure the site. Protesters objecting to both fracking and gas exploration had held a permanent vigil at the quarry. The aim of the borehole was to check if there was enough gas below ground to warrant seeking a licence to set up a fracking operation. Protesters said they feared a borehole could be the first step towards the setting up of an industry that they believe could damage the environment and the health of local residents. The borehole drilling process would not have involved fracking. Currently, Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in, the SDLP and UUP say they oppose fracking, while the DUP has said exploration should take place, and any application for extraction should be judged at the time.

Will there be much change between now and then?\" Anthony Reuben, from BBC Reality Check, had this answer: \"The BBC does not give financial advice, but here are a few things to bear in mind... \"The exchange rate between the pound and the dollar reflects the views of investors about the relative strengths of the two economies. \"Since the Brexit vote in June the pound has fallen about 18% against the dollar on the judgment that growth is likely to be stronger in the US than the UK and that UK interest rates are falling while the next movement in US rates is expected to be upwards. \"But it's always possible that something could happen to change that view - there is a presidential election in the US in November, for example. The outcome of that could make a considerable difference to the exchange rate. \"You do not necessarily have to put all your eggs in one basket - there is also the option to hedge your bets and buy half of your dollars now and half of them just before you go, as long as you are not going to be hit by extra charges for carrying out two transactions. \"It is always worth shopping around when buying currency - avoid buying your currency at the last minute at the airport.

With Caolan Mooney starring, the Mournemen extended their advantage to six midway through the second half. Meath reduced Down's lead but they home side held on after a nervous finish. Down went into the game propping up Division Two after disappointing opening defeats by Fermanagh and Clare. County secretary Sean Og McAteer felt compelled to release a length statement on Thursday night denying reports of unrest within Eamonn Burns' squad and Saturday's win will be a huge boost for the management. After hammering Derry at Navan two weeks ago, Meath were favourites heading into the Pairc Esler contest but the Mournemen produced a performance of grit and determination to chisel out the vital Division Two victory. Murphy's goal, as he flicked a mishit Darragh O'Hanlon free past Paddy O'Rourke, was the perfect start for the home side as they were never headed in the contest. With midfielder Peter Turley putting himself about and former under-age star Mooney producing his best game in the Down senior jersey, the home side pushed on from leading only 1-1 to 0-3 to move five ahead by the interval. O'Hanlon slotted three first-half frees while the impressive Conor Maginn, Barry O'Hagan (two), Ryan Johnston and Aidan Carr also got on the scoresheet for Down in the opening period. Fresh from his Sigerson Cup heroics with St Mary's, Kevin McKernan also excelled in the opening period for the Mournement as Meath laboured, with free-taker Donal Lenihan hitting three of their points. A McKernan point extended Down's lead to 1-11 to 0-8 by the 52nd minute after a great block at the other end by Carr had prevented Brian Menton for netting a Meath goal. After their struggles in recent times, it was not a surprise to see Down attempting to hold on to their lead in the closing stages and Meath, helped by the introduction of the speedy Eamonn Wallace, reduced the margin to three by the time the game entered injury time. Inevitably, there was a late scare for Down as Lenihan aimed for goal from his last-gasp 13-metre free and the ball skimmed off the crossbar over for a point before the final whistle was blown seconds later.

Terry Yorath was the first Welshman to play in a European Cup final, as it was then, when his Leeds side of 1975 lost 2-0 to Bayern Munich in Paris. For a man raised in the city's Grangetown area, the sight of club football's biggest global game being staged in Cardiff is still something Yorath finds hard to believe. \"I never thought a European Cup final would be here in Cardiff in my lifetime,\" said Yorath. \"We have a fantastic stadium and when the Italians and Spaniards come here they will enjoy the city and make it one big party. We should be proud of that.\" Bale will aim to fulfil the dream of playing in his home city as he hopes to shrug off an injury which has sidelined him for almost a month. \"I hope Gareth plays because it would be great for him,\" said Yorath. \"When you look back 12 months when the game was announced, he would have been thinking 'I hope we are there'. His family must be so proud. \"He is injured at the moment, but it would be fantastic if he scored and Real Madrid won.\" While Bale might be the latest Welshman to appear in a European final, Yorath was the first as he played his part during Leeds' controversial 2-0 defeat to a German side captained by Franz Beckenbauer in the French capital 42 years ago. A series of refereeing decisions went against the English champions that day and crowd trouble involving Leeds fans marred the Parc des Princes occasion in which fellow Welshman, goalkeeper Glan Letheran, was an unused Leeds substitute. \"You never dream about it, but afterwards you look back and think how many people have actually played in a European Cup final,\" said Yorath. \"I am one of the lucky few and nobody can ever take that away from you. \"But we got beaten and the crowd trouble at the end marred everything. \"The Leeds crowd weren't good that day. I got substituted about 15 minutes before the end and had to walk behind the goal where the Leeds fans were and it was then the Leeds crowd started throwing seats. \"As I was walking by with the seats coming over the top of me, I thought I hadn't played that bad had I? \"But the referee wasn't good either. We were cheated, but we were used to that at Leeds.\" Being the first Welshman to play in a European Cup final allied with captaining his country in 42 out of 59 internationals and managing his nation formed the bedrock for Yorath becoming the 21st footballer to be inducted into the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame dinner in Cardiff. Yorath was added to the roll of honour alongside Wales and Lions rugby star Graham Price, Olympics sprinter Christian Malcolm and ex-Glamorgan cricketer Peter Walker. \"It fees fantastic because when I came here down from Leeds, I didn't have a clue and believed I was just being invited here as a guest,\" said Yorath. \"I am not sure how this has happened. I thought I would just go down and see my sister who lives in Cardiff. \"To be honoured in such a way is something I never expected. \"I thought my days of being named in a Hall of Fame or recognised by anyway with Wales were over. I am 67 now although I don't feel it. \"This is probably one of the best things that has ever happened to me in football including playing in European Cups and Cup finals. \"Nothing will ever surpass this as far as sport goes. \"I now live in Leeds and nobody understands what being Welsh is. \"They don't understand how involved I get involved with whatever sport Wales play, why I have tears when the national anthem is played. \"I love everything about Wales.

Conflict, poverty and humanitarian crises are seen as major factors that leave girls exposed to child marriage. \"Child marriage starts a cycle of disadvantage that denies girls the most basic rights to learn, develop and be children,\" said Save the Children International CEO Helle Thorning-Schmidt. \"Girls who marry too early often can't attend school, and are more likely to face domestic violence, abuse and rape.

It later emerged he had shared classified material with her. He served as a senior officer under Presidents Bush and Obama. He was the commander of US and Nato forces in Afghanistan, before retiring from the military to take the top position in the Central Intelligence Agency. Asked if he thought Mr Trump had the correct temperament to be the US President, he said: \"It's up to Americans at this point in time not only to hope that that is the case, but if they can, endeavour to help him.\" He then indicated he would personally serve under Mr Trump if asked. \"If you're asked, you've got to serve - put aside any reservations based on campaign rhetoric... and figure out what's best for the country,\" he said. \"I've been in a position before where a president has turned to me in the Oval Office in a difficult moment, without any pleasantries, and said 'I'm asking you as your president and Commander in Chief to take command of the international security force in Afghanistan.' \"The only response can be: 'yes, Mr President,'\" he continued. A number of media outlets have linked the retired general with positions in the new administration. A report in The Guardian last week linked Gen Petraeus to the race for secretary of state, citing diplomatic sources. Mr Trump has been putting together his administration made up of friends, family, and former rivals - but several key positions, including secretary of state, remain open.

Stevie Mallan though had earlier missed the game's best chance for the home side when he failed to score from the penalty spot. St Mirren now lead Group G by three points. It might have been picture postcard weather for the first half in Paisley, but there wasn't much to write home about. St Mirren were too predictable with long balls floated forward for John Sutton and David Clarkson up front, although Mallan's dead ball delivery was, as always, a threat. Ayr started well enough and Paul Cairney had a real early chance, but after that Saints looked comfortable at the back. St Mirren's best chance of the half fell for Calum Gallacher who got on to the end of a lovely ball from Clarkson. It was screaming for the first-time volley, but he chose the wrong option in taking a touch and the opportunity melted in the evening sun. Things, we hoped, could only get better in the second half. They did. A bit. Lewis Morgan was highly impressive down the left side for the home team, embracing the concept of dazzling wing play and hitting the by-line before delivering the cross. But no-one could cash in. He won his team a penalty with another dazzling run. The usually deadly Mallan took the spot kick, but United goalkeeper Greg Fleming produced a wonderful save to his right hand side to urge the game toward further penalties after 90 minutes. But then central defender Baird chipped in with his last-minute effort, bundling the ball over the line after a scramble in the box. Enough to set Saints proudly at the top of their section. St Mirren manager Alex Rae: \"We struggled to get any intensity in the first half. I'm conscious of the fact it was really warm out there tonight. \"A lot of the boys are just not up to speed.

We're a mile short in terms of bodies and fitness but a draw would have been fair.

Mohammed Nowrouz Noori is an Afghan man in his late 30s but he is already a broken man. In January this year he set off with his wife Nilufar, son Mohammad and baby daughter Nastaran from the Turkish coast heading for Greece. \"When we were boarding my son said 'Dad I have prayed that we reach to other side safely',\" Nowrouz says as he recounts the tragedy at the family home back in Kabul. \"We could see lights from Greece. I reassured him, saying 'tonight is the last night of our troubles'.\" But the boat arranged by people smugglers soon got into trouble and capsized. \"In a matter of seconds water was everywhere, filling the boat. It was dark. I lost my children and my wife who had been sitting next to me,\" Nowrouz says. At least 39 migrants, including several children drowned that day. Nowrouz was among more than 60 rescued, What came next was a 12-day struggle to recover the bodies of his loved ones and bring them home for burial. Read more: The untold story of Europe's drowned migrants Anatomy of a shipwreck Nowrouz says he received medical treatment in a camp on the Turkish coast where police showed him photos of bodies which had been recovered. \"I saw my family's pictures there,\" he says. \"I saw the photo of my one-year-old daughter, my six-year-old son and my wife who was 25. I lost them.\" A police officer asked whether Nowrouz intended to bury his family in Turkey or take them home. After phoning relatives he decided the family should be buried in Kabul. The next day a minibus took Nowrouz and other survivors to Istanbul where he turned to the Afghan consulate for help. \"They said that I have to repatriate the bodies myself,\" he says. At the Afghan consulate in Istanbul, Zia Zaki is one of those trying to cope with the fallout from the migrant crisis. \"We have assembled a team of three people to deal specifically with refugee issues,\" he says as he sifts through piles of documents. \"In the last incident I attended there where 25 Afghans who lost their lives at sea. I saw a child's body in the cold room. \"I have my own small child. I tried to stay strong because it was my job to be there and identify the bodies. But when I returned home I looked at my child and I cried.\" Nowrouz spent days calling relatives back home. \"I had to borrow money to repatriate my family back to Afghanistan,\" he says. The consulate told Nowrouz that the bodies of his wife and children were kept in Bursa, a town 300km (187 miles) inland from where the accident happened. He hired a car for the four-hour drive, leaving in the middle of the night. He also booked flights to Kabul for the following evening. But once in Bursa, he could find only the bodies of his wife and son; his baby daughter was missing. With flights arranged he had little choice but to leave her behind to be buried in one of Bursa's cemeteries. At Bursa's Kent cemetery, Imam Neshet Kaya performs the funeral rites for deceased migrants. \"I just buried a child who has no name and we don't know who he was,\" he says. \"He was buried here surrounded by me and a few cemetery workers. Today we are his brother, sister and his family.\" Whether he buried Nowrouz's daughter here is impossible to know. Many of the migrant victims are Muslim and the imam says he makes sure they are buried properly. \"We go to hospital to pick up the body and bring it here to perform the Islamic rituals, washing them and wrapping them in a shroud,\" he says.  \"Later we perform the prayers at the mosque.\" The cemetery keeps records of each grave together with available documents, photos or DNA records to allow possible identification and exhumation if a body is claimed at a later date. For Afghans taking a body home means travelling by air. In Bursa, Mr Nowrouz bought coffins for his wife and son, hired an ambulance and headed back to Ataturk airport for the flight to Kabul. At Istanbul airport, Sohila Shalizai runs the office of Afghanistan's Ariana airline - the tragedy of migrants' deaths has become overwhelming here too. \"Lately we have been carrying at least two or three, even up to seven bodies on each flight,\" Ms Rizi says. \"Sometimes we can't cope with the numbers of bodies that come to us and we have refer people to Turkish airlines. Sometimes most of our cargo is coffins.\" Her colleague, Khan Mohamad, says the airline has transported 70 bodies back to Afghanistan over the last 12 months. \"I just returned from customs where I have processed another coffin which came from Izmir.\" Sometimes, Mohamad says, families don't have the money. \"They lose it all when they capsize or the smugglers take it. Last time we sent four bodies to Afghanistan and the relatives still need to pay.\" Nilufar and Mohammad were buried the day they arrived back in Kabul. But even in grief the family is not united. \"I wanted to bring my daughter's body to Afghanistan too\", Nowrouz says, \"but because the whole process took so long I couldn't find her.\" Compounding the heartbreak of losing his family, he now has debts to worry about as well. Having borrowed $8,500 to cover the costs of the ordeal, Nowrouz has been left bankrupt by a journey that already cost him everything. Additional reporting from Ismael Shahamat and Johannes Dell",

The Scottish Tories have seen double-digit increases in their vote in almost every seat. They've more than doubled their returns in some places where the party was previously unelectable. First they knocked off Angus Robertson, the SNP's deputy leader and top dog at Westminster. They had called that their \"Portillo moment\" - but their best was yet to come, as they dethroned Alex Salmond in Gordon. They even overturned the fourth-safest seat in the country, in Banff and Buchan. Other Scottish Tory gains include: It's been a long time since the Tories have had a night like this in Scotland. In four elections in a row, they returned a single MP. The year before that, 1997, they got zero. You have to go back to 1992 for the last time they won more than a single seat in Scotland. They ended up with 13 - the party's best showing north of the border since 1983. What this Tory resurgence means for the rest of the UK in terms of parliamentary calculations is unclear. The margins are razor-thin, so every seat is precious. But the Tories are resolute in what they believe it means for Scotland. \"Indyref2 is dead,\" Ms Davidson says. The prospect of a second independence referendum has been at the core of the Tory campaign, and indeed their entire revival in Scotland. The SNP have a majority of seats, and thus a \"triple lock\" mandate for that referendum, according to their manifesto - but it certainly seems a more distant prospect than ever.

Saints deservedly doubled their lead through midfielder Jake Hesketh's first goal for the club just after the hour. Connor Wickham had Palace's best chance but failed to latch on to a loose back header from Jose Fonte inside the box. Austin's fourth goal in the space of six days and three games gave Claude Puel's Southampton a deserved lead after half an hour. Palace lost captain Scott Dann early on to a suspected hamstring injury and it was his replacement Kelly who was at fault in the build-up to the opening goal. The central defender failed to control the ball with his chest and as it ran away from him Long gave chase and was tripped inside the box. Long almost netted a goal of his own in the closing stages of the first half when he rounded Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey, but his finish lacked power and allowed Damien Delaney to clear off the line. Saints' continued pressure in the second half finally told as they doubled their lead through 20-year-old Hesketh. Long drove into the box and when his shot was saved by Hennessey the rebound broke to Hesketh, who calmly swept a left-footed finish into the bottom corner. Southampton midfielder Jake Hesketh told BBC Radio Solent: \"First and foremost we're through in the cup, but to score a (first senior) goal was perfect for me. \"It's a bit of a whirlwind really. It's come back to me nicely and then I've just run off. \"In my head I'm thinking, 'what am I doing here?' as I wasn't sure whether or not to celebrate with a knee-slide.

David Cameron has promised a referendum on UK membership of the European Union by the end of 2017. During the factory visit, Mr Farage told the BBC: \"Wales gets a rotten deal from Europe. \"Its fishing industry is being destroyed, its steel industry is being seriously damaged, little businesses like this are under threat of going out of business, and there's nothing a politician in the assembly or in Westminster can do about it.\" He said the UK had \"given away control of industry, fishing, farming and business to Brussels\".

Last week, official figures confirmed that the UK economy grew 0.5% in the final three months of 2015, with the services sector highlighted as the key factor driving growth. The Office for National Statistics said the \"buoyancy\" of services had offset the \"relative sluggishness\" of the rest of the UK economy. Signs of weakening growth in the UK economy have pushed back estimates of when the Bank of England might begin to raise interest rates. Commenting on the latest PMI survey, Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, said: \"The May Bank of England meeting had previously been seen as a possible time for a rate hike. The volatility of global markets and the self-inflicted wound of the EU referendum put paid to that months ago. \"We still believe, however, that some measures that foresee the Bank of England holding rates at 0.5% until 2020 are little short of absurd.\" Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the PMI readings would provide \"plenty of food for thought\" for the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee. He added: \"Members will have to judge the degree to which the surveys are flagging a genuine slowdown in activity growth, or merely reacting to the negative headlines since the start of the year. In reality, growth may be softening, but perhaps not as sharply as the survey data suggest.\" Meanwhile, a similar survey indicated that eurozone businesses had their worst month for more than a year in February, bolstering the case for more monetary policy easing by the European Central Bank. Markit's final composite PMI, which is regarded as a good guide to growth, fell to 53 last month from January's 53.6 - its lowest reading since the start of 2015. However, that was better than the preliminary reading of 52.7 and well above the 50 mark that denotes growth.",

Narendra Modi boasts that he does yoga for an hour every morning but he looked a little stiff as he joined 37,000 other people to perform a series of asanas - yoga positions - on the lawns outside the Indian parliament in celebration of the first UN World Yoga Day. Mr Modi had consistently said he wouldn't be taking part in the record attempt but in the event he stretched and puffed his way through the 35-minute routine with the rest of them. Some say he simply couldn't resist the opportunity for an image that will undoubtedly appear in newspapers around the world tomorrow morning. And that's in keeping with the real spirit of this event, because this is all about public relations. The Indian government's new-found enthusiasm for yoga can be traced directly back to Mr Modi.  He's already created a ministry of yoga with its own dedicated yoga minister, and his personal intervention is said to have been decisive in persuading the UN to designate June 21st as World Yoga Day. The official publicity presents today's festivities as a humble celebration of an ancient Indian tradition of exercise.  It is India's second greatest gift to the world after the number zero, according to Mr Modi's PR machine. But there was always much more to the government's agenda than that. It isn't about propagating Hindu nationalism, as some in India's Muslim minority complained. The government quickly stripped out anything that could be described as \"Hindu\" from today's event in response to these criticisms, purging the Om chant and sun salutations from the menu. But Mr Modi has recognised that yoga can do more for India than just encourage health and happiness through regular exercise. The Indian prime minister has always had a talent for publicity and he has spotted that with yoga India has a unique \"brand\" that can deliver huge economic benefits for the country. According to one estimate the worldwide yoga industry has boomed into a $30 billion-plus business. Hundreds of thousands of tourists visit ashrams and undertake yoga classes in India every year. Mr Modi is hoping tens of thousands more can be persuaded to come. But he's also got an eye on the country's wider image abroad. He sees yoga as a wonderful way to promote India in the world. What better badge of nationhood than this ancient tradition of health and harmony? And if that enhances the image of Mr Modi himself along the way, all the better, will be Mr Modi's likely judgement.",

			"Input": "summarize: It has been a busy period of transfer activity as teams look to strengthen and build on their previous campaign. With gaps to fill, many clubs have been looking outside of the Scottish border for new talent. Alongside club stalwarts and players familiar with the Scottish game, which players will help shape the season? Celtic built their title-winning side around a solid foundation at the back last season. Virgil van Dijk and Jason Denayer were at the heart of a defence that kept 22 clean sheets in the league. With the latter returning to parent club Manchester City, manager Ronny Deila has been quick to find a replacement. Dedryck Boyata signed a four-year contract this summer, ending a nine-year stay at Manchester City and the 24-year-old has already looked settled among his new team-mates. A goal on his competitive debut against Stjarnan, followed with the winner on Thursday, helped Celtic secure a 1-0 first leg lead over Qarabag. Celtic will be looking for this form to continue as they chase a fifth consecutive title. Last season, Aberdeen had their best league campaign since the 1993-94 season as they secured second place. This season, they will be looking to improve on the promising strides they have taken under Derek McInnes. The Dons have strength in depth in most departments, but the acquisition of goalkeeper Danny Ward from Liverpool on a season-long loan looks to have been a smart piece of business. McInnes deployed both Jamie Langfield, 35, and Scott Brown, 30, between the sticks last season, but the early indications seem to point to Ward being given the opportunity to stake a claim to be the club's number one this season. Impressive displays in the Europa League qualifiers have strengthened the 22-year-old Welshman's position and he could be a key factor if the Dons are to push Celtic all the way in this season's title race. Nadir Ciftci's \u00a31.5m departure to Celtic this summer has left Dundee United boss Jackie McNamara with a position to fill in his forward line. McNamara will be hoping that Croatia Under-21 cap Darko Bodul will be the man to do the job. At 26, Bodul has plenty of experience throughout Europe. Beginning his career in his native Austria with First Vienna, Bodul has also had spells with Dutch sides Heerenveen, Ajax and Sparta Rotterdam, as well as stints with Nacional of Portugal, Austrians Sturm Graz and Danish outfit Odense. He left Austrian Bundesliga side Rheindorf Altach at the end of last season. Bodul made his pre-season debut in a United shirt during the 2-1 defeat by Queens Park Rangers, coming on as a second-half substitute before starting in the 1-0 friendly defeat by Watford, lasting an hour before being replaced. McNamara described his new signing as ''technically gifted, skilful and a penalty box goal scorer\". With some impressive teams on his CV and a two-year contract, United will hope to see the best of Bodul in the coming season. He may have the most famous name in Scottish football, but Dutchman Rodney Sneijder wants to be his own man at Dundee United. The younger brother of Galatasaray midfielder Wesley, Rodney was signed on a two-year deal after his release by Almere City in his homeland. It marks the first time that the 24-year-old midfielder has played for a club outside of the Netherlands. Having begun his career at Ajax, Sneijder will be looking to kick-start his time in Scottish football when the season gets under way. With United looking to rebuild after the recent departures of Gary Mackay-Stevens and Stuart Armstrong to Celtic, it would appear that he will likely get the opportunity to do so. Sneijder may get his first chance on the opening weekend as his side face Aberdeen at Tannadice this Sunday. After winning the Championship last season, Hearts will be determined to re-establish themselves as a top-flight club after their season in the second tier. Robbie Neilson has conducted a squad overhaul as they look to build upon their title success. The conclusion of Genero Zeefuik's loan spell from Groningen has left a void up front that Neilson will be looking for Juanma Delgado to occupy. The 24-year-old Spaniard joins from Greek Super League outfit Kalloni on a three-year contract. At 6ft 2in, the former Levante youth player will have a presence in the forward line that Neilson will require to meet his ambitions of finishing in the top six this season. He is described by his new manager as \"a good player, technically very good, great in the air and has good link-up play - and he's a great character\".",

The government hopes to save \u00a31.5bn a year to help reduce the deficit. David Cameron described the move as \"fundamentally fair\" but Labour said it was a \"huge assault\" on families. Defending the policy, the prime minister said: \"I'm not saying those people are rich, but I think it is right that they make a contribution. \"If we don't raise that... from that group of people - the better off 15% in the country - we would have to find someone else to take it from.\" Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the government should tax the richest, rather than make changes that affect those on middle incomes, and described the changes as a \"complete shambles\". The change comes the day before a key Commons debate over the welfare system, when MPs discuss plans to break the link between benefit rises and inflation. Chancellor George Osborne has proposed a cap of 1% - which is below the expected rise in the cost of living - on increases in most working-age benefits, such as Jobseeker's Allowance and maternity pay, and tax credits for three years from 2013-14. Child benefit, housing benefit and universal credit will be capped for two years from 2014-15. All these changes will affect millions of people. More than 250,000 high earners have already opted out of receiving child benefit but several hundred thousand others who missed a deadline to declare they will no longer qualify will now have to fill in self-assessment tax forms. Campaigners say this has created complexity in the system. They have also pointed to the fact that a family where two parents work and both earn \u00a349,000 a year will keep their benefits, while a family with a single earner on \u00a351,000 - where the other parent may have chosen to stay at home in a caring role - will lose part of theirs. Child benefit is paid at the rate of \u00a320.30 a week for the first child, and then \u00a313.40 a week for each child after that. It lasts until each child reaches 16, or 18 if they are still in full-time education, and in some cases until they are 20. More than a million people are set to be affected by the cut, with the Institute of Fiscal Studies estimating that they would lose an average of \u00a31,300 a year. Any child benefit paid to high-earners who have failed to opt out will be clawed back through the High Income Child Benefit Charge, administered by HM Revenue and Customs. If somebody earning more than \u00a350,000 or their partner keeps claiming child benefit, then the higher earner will have to admit this in a self-assessment tax form. The IFS estimates that 500,000 extra people might have to fill in these forms as a result of the change. They will need to register for self-assessment, if they have not already, by 5 October or face a fine. A Treasury spokesman said: \"Withdrawing child benefit on the basis of the combined family income would require intrusive means-testing of all eight million households getting child benefit. The way we are doing it is simpler for the vast majority of families.\" But the stance has not been welcomed by many people who would be affected. Paul, from West Sussex, who has a six-year-old son was one of a number of people who reportedly failed to receive a letter from HMRC explaining the options for higher earners on what to do. He told the BBC: \"My salary goes up and down, but we will continue to claim it. But my tax affairs are very simple so the one thing I don't really want to do is the self-assessment thing.\" The deadline has now expired for higher earners to opt out of receiving child benefit. They will still be able to do so, but may still face a tax charge for the time still in the system since 7 January. The latest official figures from HM Revenue and Customs show that 191,873 people have opted out of receiving child benefit - mostly because they know they will consistently earn more than \u00a360,000 a year, or earn over \u00a350,000 and do not want to be pulled into the self-assessment system. That figure was expected to rise above 250,000 over the weekend. These figures will be confirmed later.",

			"Input": "summarize: Salva Kiir issued a decree dismissing all ministers and deputy ministers, as well as Vice-President Riek Machar. No clear reason was given for the sackings, but analysts say Mr Kiir and Mr Machar have been embroiled in a power struggle for months. South Sudan has suffered from chronic economic problems since it split from Sudan in 2011. There was tight security outside ministry buildings on Wednesday, while radio broadcasts urged people to remain calm, the AFP news agency reports. Its stability has been hampered by lingering rows over territory and oil with its northern neighbour. Recently some of Mr Kiir's colleagues have hinted at discontent with his leadership. Local reports say Mr Kiir is battling to maintain control of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), the former rebel group that now runs the country. Mr Machar, who had been stripped of some of his powers in April, had hinted that he may stand against Mr Kiir for leadership of the SPLM before the next presidential election in 2015. By Nyambura WambuguBBC News, Juba Dissolving the cabinet in South Sudan hints at a wider attempt by the president to restructure not only the government but power and access to power in the country. There have been reports in recent weeks of strained relations within the governing SPLM and the relationship between the president and his deputy are said to be at an all-time low. Although the cabinet restructuring has been a long time coming, its timing is curious and raises suspicions that the president could be using his executive powers to stamp out dissent in the party and disagreement within his government. Whether the sacking of the entire cabinet will succeed in calming the disquiet within South Sudan's political circles remains to be seen -there is also a real fear that this might further divide the country along ethnic lines. The BBC's Nyambura Wambugu in the capital, Juba, says there is a real fear that the sacking could further divide the country along ethnic lines. Mr Kiir is from the Dinka community, which is the largest in South Sudan, while Mr Machar is from the second-largest group, the Nuer, some of whom have complained about Dinka domination. Under-secretaries have been put in charge of the departments and the government insists it can function smoothly until new ministers are appointed. Barnaba Marial Benjamin, who had been information minister until Tuesday, characterised the sackings as a \"major reshuffle\" and said it was part of Mr Kiir's constitutional mandate. \"Some of these people will come back and some will not,\" Mr Benjamin AFP. Among the other leaders to be dismissed was Pagan Amum, the top negotiator in peace talks with Sudan. He was removed from his post as SPLM secretary general and the decree said he would be investigated for mismanaging the party. Last month Mr Kiir sacked two other senior ministers embroiled in a multi-million dollar financial scandal, a decision reportedly criticised by Mr Amum. It was unclear whether Tuesday's decree had any link to the scandal. South Sudanese journalist Nhial Bol said Mr Kiir had probably acted to end the paralysis in his government. \"Things have not been moving in the government because of this internal fighting over who is going to control the SPLM,\" Mr Bol told Reuters news agency. South Sudan is rich in oil, but is one of Africa's least developed countries, with few paved roads and poor health and educational facilities. It gained independence from Sudan in July 2011 after a decades-long civil war.

The Citizens' Assembly voted 64% to 36% in favour of having no restrictions. Anti-abortion groups have condemned the result of the vote, but any change to the law would require a referendum. The Citizens' Assembly was set up by the Oireachtas (Irish Houses of Parliament) to advise elected representatives on a number of ethical and political dilemmas facing the Irish people. These include abortion, climate change and how the Republic of Ireland deals with the challenge of providing for its aging population. The body is made up of 99 members who were chosen at random to broadly represent the views of the Irish electorate. Its most controversial task was to consider a campaign to repeal the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution - which gives an equal right to life to a pregnant woman and an unborn child. Assembly members held 10 days of intensive and emotive debates over the past five months, culminating in this weekend's series of votes. On Saturday, members voted against repealing the Eighth Amendment, but they did support change - voting to amend or replace the law. On Sunday, a majority of Citizens' Assembly members approved 13 separate grounds for legal terminations in the Republic of Ireland. Of the votes cast, 89% were in favour of allowing abortion on grounds of rape or fatal foetal abnormality - when doctors believe an unborn child is likely to die before, during or shortly after birth. There was less support for legal terminations for \"socio-economic reasons\" but still, 72% of members who took part voted in favour of abortion in those circumstances. However, anti-abortion campaigners dismissed the results of the ballots as a \"muddled and confused farce\". Cora Sherlock of the Pro Life Campaign accused the assembly of having a \"chaotic\" and \"one-sided approach\" in how it conducted its business from the beginning. She added: \"There is nothing liberal or progressive about the assembly recommending a referendum to strip unborn babies of their right to life in law and also ignoring the negative consequences of abortion for women.\" The Citizens' Assembly is chaired by the Supreme Court judge, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, who will now present a report on members' recommendations to the Oireachtas by late June. In a statement, the chair said members had \"reached a conclusion of sorts\" and she thanked them for having \"engaged with some of the most complex pieces of legislation, immersed themselves in medical and ethical discourse, and listened with respect to the voices and opinions of others\". \"I also wish to acknowledge those whose perspectives or opinions did not emerge in the final vote,\" the judge added. \"This is an exercise in deliberative democracy and their vote remains important to me because of the very fact it captures that other perspective, that dissenting voice, the different interpretation and I wish to assure them that their votes and voices will be recorded and have a place in the report.\" On receipt of her report, elected representatives will consider members' calls for a change in the law, and whether or not to hold a referendum.",

Mother-of-one Ms Jones was due to move into the house the following day, but was allowed to stay the night before. Tests on the fire showed the flue was ineffective allowing smoke to leak into the room, the Aberdare inquest heard. During those tests carbon monoxide gas was at 16 times the acceptable level. Ms Jones' father, Andrew Jones, told the inquest he knew the owner of the house, Ms Linda Parfitt, as a family friend for 25 years and he arranged to buy the house from her to use as a home for his daughter. Ms Parfitt left the property at the start of the week and Mr Jones was decorating it that week. He said he stayed there for two nights to keep the house secure. His daughter, who worked as a care worker, was due to stay there on Thursday 8 August, but Mr Jones said he had woken up cold the previous morning so decided to light the fire. He told the inquest that he told his daughter to keep a window open as he did not want her to die from carbon monoxide poisoning. He said: \"That will haunt me for the rest of my days.\" Mr Jones said his wife called him the following morning as she could not contact their daughter. He said he went to the house but the emergency services were already there. He told the coroner he identified his daughter's body later that day. Plumbing inspector Howard Reed told the coroner the fire was dirty with a lot of soot and debris. Tests showed its window and door leaked smoke and carbon monoxide tests found that after two hours there were 829 parts per million (ppm) of the gas in the room. A domestic carbon monoxide alarm would sound at about 50 ppm and levels of between 600 and 750ppm are likely to cause fatalities, the hearing was told. Debris on the fire's throat plate, which is used to restrict airflow, was blocking the flue and Mr Reed estimated it had not been removed for \"many years\". The owner of the house at the time, Ms Parfitt, told the inquest that she and her ex-partner arranged for the fire to be installed. Ms Parfitt told the inquest that a vent in the living room had been there prior to moving into the house. She said that she did not inspect it and could not explain how a magazine cover found its way into the grill opening. When shown a picture of smoke coming from the fire during the inspection after Ms Jones died, Miss Parfitt told the coroner: \"I've never seen smoke coming out of it like that - I'm sure about that.\" The inquest has now been adjourned until later in the year.",

The contract, which will also involve maintaining the fleet, will be awarded in 2019. The trains are for the first phase of the project, due to open in 2026 and run between London and Birmingham. Construction will begin later this year and it is expected to reduce rail times between Birmingham and London by 32 minutes. A second Y-shaped phase of HS2 will open in two stages. The line from Birmingham to Crewe will launch in 2027, with the remaining construction - which includes a spur taking HS2 to a new station at Manchester Airport - due to finish six years later. There will be separate contracts in the future to supply trains for this phase.

State media picked up the story on Thursday, which was first reported in a local evening paper earlier this week. Liaoshen Wanbao reported the 49-year-old woman in Shenyang city had claimed her husband had divorced her 10 years ago because he disliked the shape of her face, said to be \"large and square\" with \"fat cheeks\". She said it spurred her to undergo facial surgery three times at a local hospital to shave her jawbones and reshape her face into a slimmer shape. During the third surgery the doctors discovered that if they proceeded further her nerves may be damaged, and halted the procedure. The woman, identified only by her surname Wang, later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; \u00c2\u00a3183,900) in damages. She alleged the surgery had left her with soreness in her chin, and she could only eat and drink through a straw as \"when she exerted force on her lower jaw, she had the sensation that it would break\". The hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused. After mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, \u00c2\u00a32,200) as compensation, said the report. On Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman. One top-voted comment read: \"It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so.\" It continued: \"This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself.\" Said another Weibo user: \"Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you.\" One person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: \"1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw.\" Still others took the opportunity to crack jokes. \"What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?\" Plastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery. More than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014. The industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",

			"Input": "summarize: Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary said some forces are \"downgrading\" 999 calls, in order to justify responding to them more slowly. HMIC's report found that most of the 43 forces in England and Wales were providing a good service. But that others have let victims down. The inspectors said there are now too few detectives and in some areas an erosion of neighbourhood policing. The former chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, Sir Peter Fahy, said that forces will have to do things differently in the future, if the government continues to ask them \"to do more with less\". In its annual report on forces, the inspectors said officers were arresting fewer people and too many crimes were being shelved without proper investigation. It found that 67,000 people suspected of crimes were not entered onto the police national computer - so that all forces were made aware of them. The report highlighted measures some forces had deployed to manage demand - although in each case it was not entirely clear whether they were directly caused by cuts or local management decisions. HMIC said: \"We are leading to a very serious conclusion regarding the potentially perilous state of British policing,\" said Zoe Billingham, the lead inspector. \"Over the last few years, HMIC has said consistently that police forces were managing well in increasingly difficult circumstances. \"Nonetheless, today, I'm raising a red flag to warn forces of the consequences of what is, to all intents and purposes, an unconscious form of rationing.\" Rated \"Outstanding\": Durham Rated \"Good\": Avon & Somerset, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, City of London, Cleveland, Cumbria, Derbyshire, Dorset, Essex, Greater Manchester, Gwent, Kent, Lancashire, Lincolnshire, Merseyside, Norfolk, North Wales, North Yorkshire, Northumbria, South Wales, Suffolk, Surrey, Thames Valley, Warwickshire, West Mercia, West Midlands, West Yorkshire and Wiltshire. Rated \"Requires Improvement\": Devon & Cornwall, Dyfed-Powys, Gloucestershire, Hampshire, Hertfordshire, Humberside, Leicestershire, Metropolitan Police, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire, South Yorkshire, Staffordshire and Sussex Rated \"Inadequate\": Bedfordshire HMIC also warned there was now a \"national crisis\" caused by a shortage of detectives - with the Metropolitan Police alone short by 700. One ex-detective has told the Victoria Derbyshire programme why she quit her \"dream job\". These shortages had led to excessive workloads and stress for investigators who were sometimes carrying out complex investigations without the right skills and experience. In one area, inspectors found a uniformed officer carrying out a rape investigation. HMIC has urged police chiefs to come up with a plan by the summer to attract, recruit and train more detectives. Ms Billingham warned that while neighbourhood teams were the \"bedrock of British policing\" they were being \"chipped away... sometimes by stealth\". A survey of neighbourhood officers found they were being pulled from local duties at least once a week to supervise the detention or transport of suspects. A fifth of the officers said they could find themselves on other duties three times a week. One police officer resigned last week after 13 years in the Devon and Cornwall, publishing a damning resignation letter on social media criticising police for \"putting their employees last\". Dr Alan Billings, South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I don't think I've ever read a report from the Inspectorate that was quite as sobering as this.\" Dr Billings said there was \"no doubt\" that neighbourhood policing was under pressure, adding: \"I think that's true of my own area - because if people are really pressured to answer 999 calls, deal with incidents, they're going to pull officers out of neighbourhood areas.\" He said HMIC's report reflects what is happening across the public sector. \"You can't get away from the fact that all of us are now trying to do more and better with less. \"And year on year, we're receiving less funding. Now of course a police force cannot run a deficit - so you have to make the books balance, and that leads sometimes to poor decisions.\" Chief Constable Michael Barton of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said budgets had fallen by 22% in five years - leading to a loss of 32,000 officers and staff - at a time when many crimes were changing. \"It's a simple reality that we are required to prioritise more,\" he said. \"Difficult decisions are being made between resourcing neighbourhood teams, response units, specialist investigations and digital and cyber-enabled crime. There are no easy answers.\" Ms Billingham said the failings were \"not simply about money\" because there was a huge variation in results, in particular in how well forces were winning the support of domestic violence victims in how they investigated and concluded cases. Policing Minister Brandon Lewis said: \"This Government has protected police funding, through the 2015 spending review. \"There can be no excuse for any force that fails to deliver on its obligations. Those identified as inadequate or requiring improvement must take HMIC's findings very seriously and I expect to see rapid improvement But the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file members, described the report as a \"worrying wake-up call\". And Jon Boutcher, chief constable of Bedfordshire, criticised his force's rating as inadequate, saying community policing had to change because of the huge demand for specialist officers to deal with domestic abuse, sexual offences and the rising threat of online-related crimes.",

			"Input": "summarize: Some have asked to remain anonymous so have only given their first names. The minute's silence went relatively well because we only had two incidents. The pupils involved showed reticence so they had a chat with the civics teachers. The school was at the heart of the events, close to the Charlie Hebdo offices. One of my students heard the shots being fired by the Kouachi brothers. Many of our pupils skateboard in Place de la Republique. It all meant a lot to them. They needed to make sense what had happened. We discussed the issues: it was the first act of war in Paris for a long time. We talked about caricatures, blasphemy, freedom of speech. A few loudmouths said: \"They [Charlie Hebdo] were asking for it.\" We discussed this in class and some of them ultimately revised their opinion. So what we had was mostly blustering. It was very spontaneous. On the Thursday morning I saw some of my final-year students as I came in. They asked me for adhesive tape because they wanted to make banners. They took the initiative very quickly. They went to see the head teacher to get authorisation for their plan. They made a speech to younger students after the minute of silence on Friday, then demonstrated across the city, and of course took part in the main [unity] rally on Sunday. The initial reaction was one of unanimous revulsion among pupils. On the Thursday everyone agreed that you don't kill people because you are offended by drawings, regardless of your beliefs. On the Friday, frictions started to creep in. Then there was the mass \"Je suis Charlie\" demonstration at the weekend. When the pupils returned to school on the Monday, the disruption began. Two pupils found conspiracy theories on the internet: The Kouachi brothers were innocent\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Wasn't it strange that police had found the ID card left in the car? It was obviously a plot by intelligence services\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I asked what purpose there could be in killing people of various ethnicities and religions.  They came back with the answer: \"To sully Islam.\" I was surprised because those two boys of North African origin had never said that sort of thing. But they were defiant. I represented the official version, and they had access to a hidden truth. Problems in the school system run deep. Courses on the Enlightenment, for instance, can be a problem. In a class last week I was analysing an article by Voltaire on religious fanaticism, which is on the national curriculum. As I was talking, the pupils were listening so intently that there was silence. Suddenly two of them made increasingly loud snoring noises that ended up covering my voice. Secularism is not the only sensitive issue. It is also difficult to teach colonial wars. You will be challenged, some will whistle or hum to stop you talking. You will be accused of dishing out propaganda. I noticed an abrupt change in 2001, when I was teaching in an immigrant suburb. My students refused to observe a minute's silence for the victims of 9/11. The most radical among them started singing Hamas songs. I was a young teacher and did not know what to do. Discipline is a big problem. When people talk in class and the teacher tells them to be quiet, a common retort is: \"I'm not talking to you\" - meaning you're interrupting my conversation. What plays against me is that I am a woman - some pupils will not respect me. If I have two or three troublemakers per class here, I can only imagine what it must be like for my colleagues who have remained in deprived suburbs. Boosting civics courses and encouraging pupils to sing the Marseillaise (as the education minister suggested following 200 reported incidents during the minute's silence) does not go nearly far enough to tackle the underlying problems. When I heard pupils recycling conspiracy theories after the Charlie Hebdo attacks, it reminded me of 9/11. The very next day, on 12 September, a boy said in class that Jews were behind the attack. He knew this because there were no Jews in the twin towers at the time. I said: \"You must be really smart! We still don't know the number of victims, but you already have the list, with their religion.\" Everybody laughed. The kid felt a bit silly and I defused the situation that way. When I am confronted with that sort of thing I now use texts by Hitler, Stalin, Bin Laden and other classics of the conspiracy genre to show the similarities between their visions of the world: a hidden elite is pulling the strings - often the same people incidentally. And I show that such ideas have serious consequences: tens of millions of people killed in the case of Nazism and Stalinism. It can be tricky teaching some subjects - such as the Holocaust, colonial wars, or the Middle East - but this is mostly a problem of teacher training. When a kid tells you a genocide has been committed by the French in Algeria or by the Israelis in Gaza, you have to refer to the official definition of a genocide and see whether its applies. You are going to be challenged: background knowledge and a good relationship with pupils are vital to meet that challenge. Today teachers are competing with other sources of information - notably social networks and the internet. Teachers are no longer the ultimate source of knowledge.  So you have to be extremely strong on learning in order to have authority. And if there is an emotional bond with the pupils, you can deliver any message. On the Thursday (a day after the Charlie Hebdo attack) I was shaken by what I had seen on TV.  I spoke to the head teacher, who gave me permission to post a \"Je suis Charlie\" banner in my classroom. But he also said something that surprised me: he would not force teachers to enforce the minute's silence (declared by the education minister) on the Friday. He had anticipated problems - but I had not. I could not imagine that pupils would not observe a minute's silence. Then I faced my class of 14 to 15-year-olds, with whom I have a wonderful relationship. I asked how they felt about the events of the previous day, without giving my own reaction. Their response hit me in the guts: \"Miss, the journalists got what was coming to them\"; \"You should not mock the Prophet.\"  Only the Muslim pupils spoke - about a third of the class. The others did not say a word. When they saw the tear on my face, they held back: they did not want to upset me. In my younger class, they were even more virulent. \"When you receive death threats you have to stop what you are doing,\" they said. On the Friday they all observed the minute's silence, but I did not feel it was out of respect for the victims - but out of respect for me. Some of my colleagues who do not have that sort of relationship with their pupils had problems; others did not observe it at all. More recently, a boy mimicked the killings in a corridor, firing an imaginary Kalashnikov and shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" (God is great, in Arabic). I thought the battle of secularism had been won, and that after several years in school they had absorbed all this. But I now realise that this is not the case. But I will not give up. I will continue to fight for my convictions. I am a daughter and granddaughter of teachers: secularism and the values of the Republic are in my genes. If there were more teachers like me - more teachers who believe in what they do and stop looking the other way, things would be better.",

The Falklands Islands government also said the Argentines had no case. \"We have the right to develop our economy, including the hydrocarbons industry, and we are exercising that right,\" it said. \"It is worth remembering that it was the government of Argentina who walked away from working with the Falkland Islands on the development of a hydrocarbons industry some years ago. \"Argentine domestic law does not apply to the Falkland Islands and this latest action is clearly another attempt by Argentina to try to block economic growth in the Falkland Islands.\" Analysts suggested Argentina would have little joy in the courts. \"The Argentines will lose,\" Malcolm Bracken at Redmayne Bentley told the BBC. \"They have no jurisdiction - the UN settled the matter in 1982.\" In fact, he said the country's current position would prove counterproductive. \"All they're doing is handing any possible benefit that Argentina may have had from the oil boom in the south Atlantic to Chile. \"There'd be an awful lot of logistic support needed for drilling that simply isn't available in the Falklands. They'd need a port somewhere and that's likely to be near Chile rather than Argentina, so they're cutting their own nose off to spite their face.\" Earlier this month, Argentine foreign ministry officials said they would prosecute oil companies operating near the Falkland Islands. The officials said companies active there were operating illegally in Argentine territory. This came after the three British oil companies announced new oil and gas finds north of the islands, and as Argentina marked the 33rd anniversary of the war with the UK over the islands. Tensions between the UK and Argentina were already running high after the UK announced it would spend \u00c2\u00a3280m over the next 10 years on improving defences on the islands.",

Joe Garner headed Rangers level from a corner before the break. The visitors had several chances in the second half with Alston firing against the post while Garner had a header saved for the hosts. With Aberdeen defeated at Hamilton Academical on Tuesday and Hearts beaten at Kilmarnock, Saints could have gone second with victory but instead they go level on points with the second-placed Dons, albeit having played a game more. Rangers, having taken 16 points from a possible 30 since being promoted, stay fifth edging to within a point of Hearts. The Ibrox side have won only two of their home league games this season, having also dropped points to Hamilton and Ross County. Mark Warburton's side had improved defensively in recent weeks with clean sheets in league wins over Partick Thistle and Inverness. However, with Wes Foderingham resuming goalkeeping duties from Matt Gilks - Rangers' best player in the 1-0 Scottish League Cup semi-final defeat by Celtic - the Ibrox side found themselves a goal down early on to Saints as Alston picked his spot after robbing Lee Hodson for his first Saints goal. Tommy Wright engineered an away win over Rangers in last season's League Cup when the hosts - then in the Championship - bringing an end to a 11-game winning sequence. And the Northern Irishman's team had several opportunities to go back in front early in the second half with Brian Easton, Liam Craig, Danny Swanson and Chris Kane all going close before Alston fired against a post. Garner had netted just once since his summer move from Preston North End but the striker broke his Ibrox duck with a headed finish off Harry Forrester's corner, having gone close from a similar situation moments before. And Garner threatened to nod Rangers ahead on 74 minutes but could not beat Zander Clark, who made good first-half saves to deny Jason Holt and Josh Windass. Warburton sought fresh impetus in attack with the introduction of Martyn Waghorn, Kenny Miller and Barrie McKay off the bench but St Johnstone held firm with David Wotherspoon clearing a Miller effort off the line. Rangers' Mark Warburton: \"It was a decent first half but we didn't continue that and we gave the ball away cheaply. \"We weren't brave getting out, despite the possession stats we didn't play the way we wanted to. \"It's a demanding crowd because they're used to success. The players have to recognise it's an expectant crowd - and quite rightly. We have to respect that and learn from that.\" St Johnstone's Tommy Wright: \"It's never easy coming here. We're happy to take a point but we could have taken all three as we had a few good chances in the second half. \"We knew we'd stay above Rangers with a positive result.

Click here for live updates on this story BBS South West Political Reporter Tamsin Melville said county coroner Dr Emma Carlyon was understood to be satisfied there was a commitment locally to continue to work hard to ensure the lowest number of patients possible leave the county for treatment. An inquest in June heard that in May last year Mr Knight died of multiple injuries when he was hit by a train on the viaduct. The 29-year-old had been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia when he died. A jury said his death was contributed to by an inadequate risk assessment and support while he was on leave from Cygnet Hospital in Kewstoke, Somerset. The inquest heard Mr Knight was being treated there because there were no acute psychiatric inpatient beds available in Cornwall. The NHS said 30 adult mental patients were placed out of Cornwall in 2015/16, 150 the year before when a key unit was closed for six months, and 60 the year before that.

Russia's Sergey Lazarev had been the bookies' top tip for days, possibly because his song was so similar to 2015's Swedish winner - with innovative staging and a slick song to match. But Ukraine stole past Russia and Australia under the radar, with the new voting system providing a huge surprise at the 11th hour when Jamala was crowned as winner. She is the first Crimean Tatar to perform at the contest, and her song, 1944, could not have been further from Eurovision's usual fare. It deals with Stalin, Crimea and claims of ethnic cleansing. Jamala dedicated it to her great-grandmother and her five children, who were deported by Soviet troops from Crimea in 1944. Simon Bennett, head of the International OGAE Eurovision fan club, told the BBC that former Soviet countries that would \"normally vote for Russia\" had sent it a message by voting for Ukraine instead. Political songs are not allowed at Eurovision, but 1944 was permitted because it was based on historic fact, rather than current politics. BBC Music reporter Mark Savage wrote in February that Ukraine's 2004 Eurovision winner, Ruslana, had said the song 1944 had struck a chord over current circumstances in the region. \"This song... is precisely what we are all suffering in Ukraine today,\" she said, referencing Russia's seizure of Crimea in 2014. Jamala simply said after her win: \"I want peace and love for everyone,\" adding at the press conference: \"I was sure that if you talk about truth it really can touch people.\" But John Kennedy O'Connor, broadcaster, author and Eurovision expert, was not happy with Saturday's result. \"I'm disappointed that a dirge about genocide and delivering a pointed slap in Russia's face has won this year,\" he told the BBC. \"This contest should never be a political platform and I'm almost angry that it's been turned into one, despite the very clear rule book on the matter.\" He said that while third place was an \"excellent result\", the Russians must be \"sick as parrots\" at the moment. Alasdair Rendall, president of the Eurovision fan club OGAE UK, said immediate reaction to Jamala's victory was \"mixed\". \"Many people admired her strong voice and the impressive visuals on show,\" he told the BBC. \"However many are already saying it won due to the strong political message it carried rather than its musical quality.\" As for Australia, Bennett said it was \"neutral and easy to give your votes to\" while O'Connor said it was \"time for them to go away and start AsiaVision now\", referring to a song contest for Asia Pacific countries. And at the other end of the leaderboard, hopes for the UK's Joe and Jake were dashed when they came third from bottom. Rendall felt the result was \"totally undeserved\" and Bennett was \"distraught for them\". But O'Connor added: \"The fact that their single is not in the UK top 100 after a month [plus] since its release says it all really.\" Joe and Jake told the BBC they had given \"it their all\" and sent \"huge congratulations\" to Jamala. The new voting system also got a mixed reception, with Bennett saying it was \"a disaster that destroyed the atmosphere\"' while Rendall said it had \"really ramped up the tension\". It seems that the only thing everyone agreed on was the show itself. \"Congratulations to Swedish TV for putting on one of the most impressive, exciting and high quality Eurovisions ever,\" said Rendall.",

Souleymane Coulibaly's volley for the hosts just after the break was well saved by Gary Woods. Boyd fired into the net after connecting with an Adam Frizzell shot but the striker was flagged offside as both sides had to settle for a point. There was a familiarity about the manner in which Accies enjoyed periods of dominance and yet failed to capitalise. It is a characteristic that has haunted them throughout the early part of the season and has cost them points on several occasions. Media playback is not supported on this device So it proved again in east Ayrshire as a combination of poor finishing and good goalkeeping denied them a breakthrough. And though a point away from home might prove valuable in the final analysis, a win would certainly have been more welcome. Accies were culpable of a lack of composure and accuracy in front of goal, with the normally reliable Crawford skewing shots wide or hitting tamely into the keeper's arms. Rakish Bingham missed arguably the chance of the match when he headed wide of goal from inside the six-yard box. But Accies were not the only team guilty of profligacy in front of goal. Kilmarnock - and Boyd - in particular passed up good chances, with the striker heading off target from good positions on a couple of occasions. He was also caught offside far too often, notably when tapping Frizzell's shot into the net. When the strikers did find their shooting boots, both keepers earned their corn with some excellent saves. Woods kept out a controlled Coulibaly volley and also denied Frizzell late in the game, with the Kilmarnock substitute making a good impression from the bench. Jamie MacDonald, so often a hero for Kilmarnock, did superbly to tip Greg Docherty's goal-bound header round the post. And he did likewise with a Massimo Donati long-range volley in added time to ensure the game ended in a stalemate. Kilmarnock manager Lee Clark: \"It was a good point when you consider Jamie's made a fantastic save right at the death. I don't think we deserved anything more - Hamilton have had their fair share of opportunities. \"We've blown a big opportunity to get ourselves into the top six going into the international break and feel good about ourselves. \"In comparison to where we were in our last two home games and where we were against Inverness and St Johnstone, we didn't play enough on the front foot and we let Hamilton's shape cause us too many problems.\" Hamilton manager Martin Canning: \"I thought we deserved to win the game on opportunities created but if you're having one of those days when the ball's not going to go in for you, you need to keep the back door shut. \"I thought Dougie Imrie should have had a penalty [in the first half] - he's wrong side of the defender and I don't see why he would go down as he's driving across the box. \"If we continue to perform to a high level, I've no doubt we can win games.\" Match ends, Kilmarnock 0, Hamilton Academical 0.

Campaigners say approval would set a \"dangerous precedent\". But the company says its operations are no risk to people or the environment. Fracking involves injecting water, sand and chemicals at high pressure into rocks deep underground to unlock trapped gas. The process was banned in 2011 after the shale gas firm Cuadrilla caused minor earth tremors when it fracked a well in Lancashire. Third Energy has licences to produce gas in North Yorkshire and offshore in the North Sea. In 2013 it drilled an exploratory well near the village of Kirby Misperton, close to the North York Moors National Park. It now wants to frack the well to test whether it can unlock shale gas from rocks up to 10,000ft (3,000m) underground. \"All we want to do is test whether gas will flow from an existing well using hydraulic fracturing,\" says Rasik Valand, chief executive of Third Energy. \"What we are planning is safe. There is no risk to the environment or the public.\" But there has been strong opposition to the plan from the local community and environmentalists. Hundreds of anti-fracking protesters are expected to gather outside the council meeting in Northallerton on Friday. The council has received more than 4,000 representations, the vast majority against the proposal. Green campaigners fear that approval here would open the door for fracking elsewhere. \"It risks setting a dangerous precedent for Britain,\" says Craig Bennett, chief executive of Friends of the Earth. \"We strongly urge councillors to reject this planning application which is clearly deeply unpopular with the local community.\" Others are concerned about the impact on the local economy as Kirby Misperton is also home to Flamingo Land, one of Yorkshire's top tourists attractions. \"This place is beautiful,\" says retired bishop, the Right Reverend Graham Cray, who lives in the village. \"The economy is based on tourism and agriculture. Tourists don't come to a gas field and that is what we will turn into if we get the scale of fracking that is intended.\" Last year Lancashire County Council rejected Cuadrilla's plan to carry out exploratory drilling and fracking at two new sites on the Fylde. A planning inquiry into that application took place earlier this year. A recommendation will be sent in the summer to the communities secretary for a final decision. The Third Energy application involves an existing site that has produced gas since the 1990s. The well has already been drilled. The shale gas produced will also be sent through a network of pipes to a nearby power station. That will avoid air pollution caused by flaring gas. So the company expects the fracking activity to be completed within eight weeks. The council's planning officer has recommended that the application be approved. But it is now down to the 11 councillors on the planning committee to take the final decision. That decision may not come until Monday due to the number of people who have registered to speak at the meeting. If approved, fracking could start by the end of the year. The Department of Energy and Climate Change refused to comment on Third Energy's application ahead of the council meeting. But in a statement it said: \"Shale gas is a fantastic opportunity which will create jobs, boost our economy and strengthen our energy security. \"There is tough regulation in place to ensure that fracking can take place safely - now is the time to start exploration and find out just how much shale gas is there and how much we can get out of the ground.\" You can follow John on Twitter at @JohnMoylanBBC",

One of the big draws is the new Titanic Visitor Centre, which so far has welcomed people from 111 different countries. Belfast is no longer building ships, but it is now attracting them. The peace process has transformed the city. During the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s the cruise ship industry steered clear of Belfast. It was not until 1997 that modern luxury liners started sailing up Belfast Lough. In recent years, numbers have soared. Next year, more than 50 are expected. So what's the big attraction? The Giant's Causeway, golf and Titanic Belfast are pulling in the visitors. However, there is also a human factor - curiosity. Gerry Lennon, chief executive of the Belfast Visitor and Convention Bureau, said: \"Curiosity is a huge driver for tourism. A lot of people are curious about Belfast and Northern Ireland. \"The political stability has given us that ability to go to the market-place and now say 'look what we have to offer'.\" The Glens of Antrim, the walls of Londonderry and Belfast's shopping districts are also proving popular. The recent three nights of rioting in one part of north Belfast do not seem to have put people off. Money has been invested in Belfast Harbour to ensure it can cope with the increasingly large vessels sailing into the city, including the latest arrival, the 113,000-tons Emerald Princess. Tony McAuley, commercial officer for Belfast Harbour, said: \"Once we get people here, the facilities almost sell themselves.\" The Titanic Visitor Centre has attracted more than 500,000 visitors since it opened six months ago - double what was expected. The cruise ship business alone is worth an estimated \u00c2\u00a315m a year to Northern Ireland's economy. There is a certain novelty factor to Belfast at the moment. This will wear off in time.

The five-mile (8km) route, which cost \u00c2\u00a3692m, links the M74 at Carmyle to the M8 southwest of the Kingston Bridge. Planning permission for the route was granted in October 1995 and immediately opposed by Joint Action Against the M74 (Jam74) - a coalition of community, environmental and sustainable transport groups. Construction began in 2008 after a last-ditch legal bid to halt the project was abandoned by Friends of the Earth Scotland and Jam74.

The specimen now confirms that the ancestors of spiders and scorpions were related, but branched off more than half-a-billion years ago. A team of international scientists present their work in Nature. The \"great appendage\" arthropods, are an extinct group of joint-legged creatures with large claw-like appendages - or growths - protruding from their heads. The nervous system tends to be similar between major groups of animals, which helps palaeontologists work out how they are related, explained Greg Edgecombe from the Natural History Museum in London. \"The nervous system is one of the more reliable tool-kits we have. We were trying to investigate whether there was evidence for the preservation of neural tissues from very early parts of the animal fossil record,\" he told BBC News. \"What we've been working with is fossils with very fine anatomical preservation from the Cambrian period. These have given us information about brains, the nerve cords and the neural tissue that goes into the eyes.\" New to science, the fossil was recently discovered in South China and is part of the genus Alalcomenaeus. This group had segmented bodies equipped with about a dozen pairs of appendages which enabled the creatures to swim or crawl. It was placed in a CT scanner and compared with other arthropods in order to understand its evolution. The team then used 3D software to see structures not visible on the surface of the fossil. \"People like myself who are mad keen on creepy crawlies want to understand how very strange early arthropods relate to living ones,\" added Dr Edgecombe. \"By having access to the nervous system it allows us to study the evolutionary relationships of very ancient fossils using the same kind of information that we would use for living animals.\" Co-author, Xiaoya Ma, also from the Natural History Museum, said: \"It is very exciting to use new techniques to successfully reveal such a complete central nervous system from a 520-million-year old fossil, and in such detail.\" She told the BBC's Science in Action programme that the high resolution of the reconstructed image allowed the team to see \"the concentrated neural structures in the head region\". They could also observe the segments of the brain associated with the claw-like appendages. The fossil belongs to an extinct group of marine arthropods known as megacheirans, Greek for \"large claws\". To infer the evolutionary relationships between species, the fields of palaeontology and neuroanatomy came together. Nicholas Strausfeld was from the anatomy side of the team at the University of Arizona, US. \"We now know that the megacheirans had central nervous systems very similar to today's horseshoe crabs and scorpions,\" said Prof Strausfeld. \"This means the ancestors of spiders and their kin lived side by side with the ancestors of crustaceans in the Lower Cambrian.\" He added that their prominent appendages were clearly used for grasping and holding. \"Based on their location, we can now say that the biting mouthparts in spiders and their relatives evolved from these appendages.\" The team says they expect to find more fossils dating even further back, which will shed new light onto the ancestors of many of today's arthropods.",

Leaders from other religions have also been invited, to \"demonstrate unity\". The MCB has raised concerns about anti-Muslim sentiment since 17 people were killed by Islamist militants in Paris last month. Announcing Visit My Mosque Day, the MCB said: \"Mosques will be sharing tea and refreshments alongside an insight into the day-to-day goings on of a busy Muslim centre of worship. Members of the Muslim community \"may be on hand to answer questions about Muslims and Islam where this is possible,\" it said. \"Local mosques will also be inviting inter-faith leaders as well, and all will be invited to come together to demonstrate unity and solidarity during what has been a tense time for faith communities.\" Speaking outside the East London Mosque in Whitechapel, MCB assistant secretary general Miqdaad Versi said the organisation wanted to \"de-mystify what Islam, Muslims and mosques are all about\". \"People can have the opportunity to understand these things directly from people that they can speak to, and by actually experiencing these institutions and coming into mosques they can break down the barriers that they previously had,\" he said. Mr Versi said there had been a rise in \"Islamophobia\" since the Paris killings, with attacks on three or four mosques, more verbal attacks against Muslims and \"a lot more hate mail\" being received by the MCB. \"For us it's important to try and create a positive image, and not let the actions of a few impact the reality of the many,\" he added. The Reverend Fred Ashford-Okai, one of those who visited East London Mosque earlier, said: \"The more we know about each other - Muslims, Christians, Jews, even those with no faith - the more we can actually live a more cohesive life in our community.\" More than 20 mosques were expected to take part. The figure is a small proportion of the total number of mosques in Britain, which is estimated to be 1,750. The MCB said only 55-60% of mosques were affiliated to it, and the total includes small establishments such as prayer rooms in schools and offices.",

The improved offer raises the valuation of Alstom's energy business by 400m euros to 14.6bn euros. The move by Siemens and Mitsubishi comes just a day after rival bidder General Electric sweetened its offer. On Thursday, GE offered to create a joint venture with the firm's nuclear and energy businesses and to sell its profitable rail signalling business to Alstom. However, it did not increase its $17bn bid. Alstom, which also makes the high-speed TGV train, is seen as one of France's key industrial firms. The French government can therefore block a foreign takeover of the firm. As a result, all parties have discussed their offers with French President Francois Hollande, who is concerned about the break-up of Alstom and the loss of jobs. The rival bidders have also been sweetening other parts of their bid. GE's previous offer had been for a straight purchase of Alstom's power business. But it has now proposed to also create a joint venture with Alstom in the nuclear and energy business and to sell its rail signalling business to Alstom. \"The alliance will retain and strengthen France's presence in the energy business and reinforce Alstom Transport,\" said GE's chief executive, Jeff Immelt. \"It creates jobs, establishes headquarters decision-making in France and ensures that the Alstom name will endure.\" On Friday, Siemens also offered to enter into a \"immediate\" joint venture with Alstom in mobility management for the rail business, including signalling. \"The specified proposal continues to preserve Alstom's current perimeter in almost all its activities, enhances its industrial sustainability, strengthens its financial structure,\" Siemens and Mitsubishi said in a joint statement.",

			"Input": "summarize: BBC Radio 4's File on 4 programme discovered 22 profiles belonging to men convicted of child sex offences, which included grooming a child on Facebook and attempting to meet her for sex. Six of the accounts remained live three weeks after the BBC reported them. Facebook's UK policy director Simon Milner said the company was effective in dealing with the issue. He said he appreciated the BBC bringing the pages to light but said Facebook worked proactively to search out behaviour that should not be happening on the site. According to the platform's own rules, convicted sex offenders are not allowed to use the social media network. Among the profiles uncovered was one belonging to Bruce Cordwell, 20, who groomed 15-year-old Kayleigh Haywood through Facebook and Whatsapp just days before she was raped and murdered by another man, Stephen Beadman, in November 2015. \"It's absolutely vile,\" said Stephanie Haywood, Kayleigh's mother, when she was shown Cordwell's page. Kayleigh, from Measham, Leicestershire, was contacted by 28-year-old Luke Harlow on Facebook in 2015 and the pair exchanged more than 2,600 messages during a two-week period. After Harlow convinced art enthusiast Kayleigh he was her boyfriend, she agreed to stay over at his flat in Ibstock. The following night, his neighbour Stephen Beadman came round to the flat and later raped and murdered the teenager before dumping her body in a hedgerow. Beadman was jailed for 35 years for murder, rape and false imprisonment, and Harlow received a 12-year sentence for meeting a child following sexual grooming, sexual activity with a child and false imprisonment. But while detectives were investigating the case, they discovered Cordwell, then 19, had also been sexually grooming Kayleigh. In February, he was jailed for three years and seven months after pleading guilty to attempting to arrange the commission of a child sex offence. Stephanie, a mother-of-eight, said convicted child sex offenders who remained on social media posed a huge risk. \"There is a risk they could do what they've done again, or worse,\" she said. \"I say, 'Once a groomer always a groomer.' \"Once they've been inside for whatever they've done, I think they should remove it. I think it's horrible.\" By comparing police mug shots and media coverage of child sex abuse cases and cross-referencing them with the details on Facebook, File on 4 tracked down accounts belonging to 22 convicted offenders. Facebook has a rule that forbids convicted sex offenders from using its site and has a portal for people to report pages belonging to offenders. The portal requires people to supply a link to the offender's page and provide evidence of their offending, which could be a link to a media report of the court case. Facebook then checks on the offenders with the police before removing them from the site. When the BBC reported the 22 pages it had found, most were removed within 48 hours - but six remained live three weeks after the BBC reported them. Facebook said it was waiting for confirmation from police that the final six were convicted offenders before it could remove the pages. In response to File on 4's findings Facebook's UK policy director Simon Milner, said: \"We appreciate you did that, we appreciate it when anybody reports to us things that are happening on Facebook that shouldn't be. \"Our teams that focus on this work with the relevant local police force to get authorisation from them and it works.\" Mr Milner said Facebook worked proactively to search out behaviour that should not be happening on the site. He added: \"We've found in terms of our working relationship with law enforcement in this country and elsewhere they think we are amongst the most effective companies in dealing with this issue and we actually do have the right kind of arrangements in place.\" Meanwhile, exclusive figures obtained by File on 4 through Freedom of Information requests revealed the most popular social media platforms had been linked to more than 7,000 reports of child sex crimes over the past three years. Figures from 22 police forces revealed 7,162 child sex offences had been recorded between 2014-15 and 2016-17, with a 44% increase recorded over the three-year period. The offences included rape, sexual activity with a child and child sexual grooming involving children as young as three years old.

The Sampurna Swarajya tanker's second officer had earlier spotted the fishing boat 2.5km away off the coast of Gopalpur in Orissa. The men had been surviving off ice from their cold storage after food and drinking supplies were washed away. \"The sea was very, very turbulent, there was a depression... which was stagnant for two or three days and it had intensified into a deep depression,\" Capt Menon told BBC World News TV. \"It was a very difficult task but we had to do it because if I didn't do that I was knowing very well that these fishermen never stood a chance of rescue, no survival at all.\" As far as being a path-breaking female ship captain goes, Radhika Menon doesn't appear to make a big deal of it.

At least 67 people died when suspected al-Shabab militants stormed the Nairobi shopping centre on 21 September. The Kenyan military says it is investigating the looting allegations. News agencies say the CCTV footage is taken inside the entrance to the Westgate mall's Nakumatt supermarket, which sells everything from food to televisions. In one section of footage, several soldiers are seen walking out of the supermarket, past a blood-spattered floor, carrying plastic carrier bags. In another clip, Kenyan soldiers can be seen next to a mobile phone outlet. Heroes of attack Victims of attack One reaches over the counter, and apparently removes a white item. Then more soldiers remove white items, which the Reuters news agency describes as mobile phone boxes. The Westgate attack sparked a four-day siege in which large parts of the shopping centre were destroyed. The Kenyan military says it has launched an investigation into the looting allegations, which correspondents say will have angered many Kenyans. At the weekend, Kenya's biggest-selling newspaper, The Nation, ran an article entitled \"Shame of soldiers looting Westgate\". The footage of the alleged looting emerged as the Kenyan authorities announced they had recovered the body of what they consider to be a fourth attacker. \"Today, Sunday 20 October 2013, we recovered a fourth body, which we know from CCTV footage to be that of a terrorist,\" said the Kenyan interior minister, Joseph Ole Lenku. \"DNA and other investigations will confirm their identities. We have also recovered four AK47 assault rifles which we know were used by the terrorists in the assault. We also recovered 11 magazines of AK47 assault rifles.\" Officials had initially said 10 to 15 gunmen were involved, but CCTV footage appears to show only four militants. It is still not clear whether some of the attackers might have escaped. The Somali militant group al-Shabab said its members staged the attack in response to Kenya's army carrying out operations on Somali territory. Last week, the BBC's Newsnight programme revealed that one of the suspected attackers was believed to be a 23-year-old Somalia-born Norwegian national, Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow. His family fled to Norway in the 1990s, but he returned to Somalia in 2009 and allegedly joined the Somali militant group. Sources in al-Shabab have told the BBC Somali Service that Dhuhulow attended a training camp in El Bur in central Somalia, one of the militants' main bases. The sources said Dhuhulow took part in many al-Shabab operations in Mogadishu and Kismayo and was well-known in jihadist circles.",

Lives could depend on police forces continuing to get access to the data on devices used by criminals and terrorists, he said. The FBI was talking to both Apple and Google about its fears, said Mr Comey. The conversations with tech firms needed to be had before the day when police forces lost access to those devices, he said. \"I'd hate to have people look at me and say, 'Well how come you can't save this kid?' 'How come you can't do this thing?'\" said Mr Comey in a briefing. His comments came in reaction to a decision by Apple to enable a file encryption system on its iOS 8 software for which it has no keys. This means it would not be able to comply with any official request to help police get at the data on those devices. Google has said it too is planning to enable a similar encryption system by default on the next version of Android. Mr Comey said he was \"very concerned\" about these plans because of what they would allow people to do. \"What concerns me about this is companies marketing something expressly to allow people to place themselves beyond the law,\" he said. \"I am a huge believer in the rule of law, but I am also a believer that no-one in this country is beyond the law,\" he added.

Ten days prior to Mr Comey's press statement, iOS data forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski pointed out that Apple's encryption system would not stop police getting at data on portable devices.

The 33-year-old was sent in to remove debris from a chemical tank with limited protective clothing in August 2011. The firm will be sentenced for health and safety breaches in October. Dundee Sheriff Court heard that Mr Conway sent into the tank containing \"volatile\" chemicals while wearing only trainers, tracksuit bottoms and a t-shirt and fleece. The mask he was given did nothing to protect him from the toxic fumes let off by the chemicals, which were used to strip alloy wheels for cars. Co-workers found the father of two unconscious inside the tank, and he was taken to hospital before being pronounced dead. A post-mortem examination found he had suffered chemical burns from contact with hydrofluoric acid. Pathologists concluded he had died from inhaling industrial paint stripper. Prosecutors said the tank Mr Conway was working in was not properly ventilated, the gloves he was given had holes in them and the face mask he was wearing was actually releasing \"contaminants\" into his air supply. The court also heard that there were no safety protocols in place at the premises, no risk assessment was carried out and there was no safe system of work in place. Defence advocate Gavin Anderson said the company had undertaken extensive efforts to adhere to health and safety standards since Mr Conway's death. He said: \"I express publicly in open court that Mr Conway's tragic death is genuinely and deeply regretted by all associated with the company. \"He had been a friend of Mr Marr for seven years prior to this and was valued not only as an employee but also as a friend.\" Diamond Wheels (Dundee) Ltd, registered at Nethergate, Dundee, pleaded guilty to a charge under the Health and Safety at Work Act. Sheriff Alistair Brown deferred sentence until October for the Crown and defence to make written submissions. Addressing Mr Conway's parents in the public benches, he said: \"Nothing that I can say or do will bring him back and I recognise that. \"It is certainly not the case in selecting a fine that I will be in any way seeking to put any kind of value on him or his life. \"It is important to keep in mind that Mr Conway died as a result of this - he's not to be forgotten in this process.\"",

Dyfed-Powys Police said the force was in discussions with the auditors. Carmarthenshire council said it was pleased the auditor did not rule its pension policy as unlawful. The public spending watchdog report said that both authorities had acted unlawfully in allowing the chief executives to opt out of the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) to avoid potential tax payments. Mr James was also unlawfully given an indemnity against potential libel costs. Assistant auditor general Anthony Barrett said: \"Carmarthenshire council has acted unlawfully on two fundamental issues, both of which the public need to be fully aware of. \"The authority has taken decisions and used taxpayers' money in areas that they do not have the legal powers to do so.\" In a separate report on Pembrokeshire council, Mr Barrett concluded similar pension arrangements for some senior officers were also contrary to law. It is expected that by the end of March 2014, \u00a351,011 will have been paid to chief executive Mr Jones and one other senior officer. The auditor said the decisions to allow certain officers to receive payments, and then for payments to be made, were unlawful on several grounds. \"The public should be able to expect the highest standards of decision making at local authorities and the council must now address the procedural weaknesses I have identified in my report,\" he said. \"It needs to demonstrate to its electorate that it is operating in accordance with the law and in line with good governance principles.\" Mr Barrett said neither council had the lawful power to give cash supplements in lieu of pension contributions to avoid tax liabilities, but said it was up to the local authorities whether they tried to claw back any money. Mr Barrett conducted two reports into Carmarthenshire council - the first into pension payments, and another into the decision to grant an indemnity to the chief executive to bring a libel counterclaim. He said the council acted \"contrary to law\" by allowing senior officers to opt out of the LGPS. More than \u00a327,000 was paid to Mr James under the scheme since 2012. Mr Barrett said the council had since \"rescinded its decision to offer a pay supplement in lieu of pension contributions and announced that no further payments will be made to the chief executive from January 2014\". The original decision taken in November 2011 was considered by the council's executive board without appearing on the agenda and without being open to inspection by members of the public. In his report on the libel indemnity, the auditor said the council \"does not have the legal powers to make such payments and there were inadequacies in the processes adopted by the council when making the decision\". It concerned Mr James's libel action against Jacqui Thompson, a blogger who was arrested after filming a council meeting on her mobile phone. He won the case and Ms Thompson was ordered to pay costs of \u00a323,217. Her own attempt to sue Mr James for libel during the course of the dispute was rejected. Carmarthenshire has paid out more than \u00a326,000 in external legal costs since 2012 under the decision to indemnify its chief executive. The auditor added: \"The libel counterclaim is still on-going and it is unclear what the final external legal costs to the council will be.\" Carmarthenshire council said is was pleased the report did not think its pensions policy was unlawful but that its procedural process was flawed. It said steps had been taken to sure ensure such matters are considered as separate items on an agenda. The council said it remained convinced that indemnifying Mr James in the libel action was correct, and claimed the audit office had not objected to the policy when first consulted on it. The local authority noted that the audit office had changed its mind on the issue some months later, and claimed it was \"too late for us to turn back the clock\". Pembrokeshire council also insisted its pension payment policy was lawful. Reacting to the report, deputy leader Rob Lewis said: \"While I note the auditor's views in relation to the decision taken, I am pleased he has concluded the council could take a lawful decision once a number of procedural matters have been addressed.\" Janet Finch-Saunders, the Welsh Conservatives' shadow minister for local government, said: \"These reports are further evidence of the need for a Wales-wide review of senior pay in Welsh local authorities, which is out of control and failing to deliver value for money for hardworking families.\" She told BBC Good Morning Wales: \"We do have some excellent local authorities, but this has cast a shadow now over... our chief executives, who do work within their remit in an honest and transparent manner. \"As to the consequences, it's time now for the chief executive Mark James to resign or, certainly, be instantly dismissed.\" Meanwhile, Plaid Cymru called for councillors who approved Carmarthenshire's pension and libel case payments to resign. Rhodri Glyn Thomas, the party's AM for Carmarthenshire East and Dinefwr, has also called for Mr James to quit. He added: \"This is a very dark day for Carmarthenshire, a dark day for democracy in Carmarthenshire, and is an example of what happens when you have a very weak executive and a council controlled by powerful unelected officers.\" The chair of the public accounts committee, Darren Millar, said the reports showed both councils had fallen well below expected standards. The committee will now consider these findings as part of a wider inquiry into senior managers' pay in the Welsh public sector. Dyfed-Powys Police said it was \"aware of the reports\" and \"whilst the matter hasn't been referred to us, we are in discussions with the auditor and will be making an assessment in relation to any appropriate action by the police\".",

TV cameras caught the officers removing Mr Tsang from the protest area to a nearby park and kicking and punching him as he lay on the ground. The incident, at the height of the protests, caused public outrage. Police in Hong Kong are generally well-respected and incidents of police violence are rare, though there were accusations of heavy-handedness during the protests. The 2014 protests saw 79 days of student-led demonstrations and street occupations by protesters seeking freedom from mainland Chinese intervention in elections for the territory's leader. Defence lawyer Lawrence Lok had argued that the protests had affected police morale, saying that one of the officers who watched the violence had been physically and verbally abused by protesters. But in sentencing, Judge David Dufton noted the men had been working under \"immense stress\" but that there was \"no justification\" for their actions. The \"vicious assault\" had \"brought damage to Hong Kong in the international community\", he said. Tuesday's ruling said Mr Tsang suffered injuries to his face, neck and body, but that these did not amount to the original charge of \"grievous bodily harm\". Last year Mr Tsang was himself found guilty of assaulting and resisting officers on the same evening. He splashed an unknown liquid on police and was handed a five-week sentence. Hong Kong has been part of China since 1997 but enjoys a high degree of autonomy under a principle of \"one country, two systems\".

Two men were found guilty of child sex abuse and another woman was found guilty of assault. Michael Rogers, 53, from Romford, was found guilty of 14 counts including cruelty, rape and inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. Jason Adams, 43, from Norwich, was convicted of 13 similar counts. Carol Stadler, 60, from Atkinson Close, Bowthorpe, Norwich, was found guilty of assault causing actual bodily harm but cleared of nine other charges, including serious sexual assaults. They are due to be sentenced on 28 September. Six other defendants, Anthony Stadler, 63, Nicola Collins, 36, Andrew Collins, 52, Judith Fuller, 32, Denise Barnes, 34, and Kathleen Adams, 84, all from Norwich, were cleared of all charges. Black sobbed uncontrollably in the dock as the verdicts were delivered. Opening the trial, prosecutor Angela Rafferty QC said Black, previously known as Marie Adams, played an instrumental role in using the five children as \"sexual playthings\". The abuse, which is said to have happened in and around Norwich and London, included forcing the children to have sex with one another. On some occasions, the adults threw parties and played card games to decide who would abuse which child, Mrs Rafferty said. In interviews the victims described how they were abused in front of one another and other adults. Some of the abuse involved children's toys, including Barbie dolls. All of the defendants denied abusing the children, saying it simply did not happen. During the trial it emerged police had launched an investigation into the conduct of one agency social worker involved in the case. The court heard that the trial had originally been due to start last year only to be delayed when prosecutors raised concerns over changes made by social workers to statements taken from the children. This resulted in Norfolk Police launching an investigation into anomalies in documents. Prosecutors decided no action should be taken, Norfolk Police said after the trial. A police spokeswoman added: \"There was no wrongdoing found on the part of the council.\" Sheila Lock, interim executive director of children's services at Norfolk County Council, said: \"The victims in this case have shown tremendous courage in speaking out. \"The needs of the children, who were central to the prosecution case, have always been at the fore of our minds and have been the main focus of all of the agencies involved. \"Our priority continues to be the children in this case who, despite the ordeal they have been through, are now doing well and are safe from harm.\" Deanna Neilson, head of safeguarding at Action for Children, said: \"This appalling case reveals the premeditated and organised approach some people take to abusing children. \"We cannot lose sight of the needs of the children who suffered at their hands, even though the abuse has stopped. \"Children must be supported, and in some cases receive therapy, to ensure they are armed with the confidence and knowledge they need to recover from this trauma.\"",

But the Labour-run Welsh government said this had not affected the scheme which had hit all its targets. Criticism has followed the closure. Chancellor George Osborne from the Conservative party, said the decision to temporarily close the scheme pointed to \"confusion\" within labour after party leader Ed Miliband had said he wanted the programme to be rolled out across the country. Campaigning in the Vale of Glamorgan, Mr Osborne said: \"I remember the Labour party urging me to take this scheme across the whole of the UK.  Now they are cutting it in Wales. \"What it points to is real confusion in the Labour party. They don't really have a clear plan for Wales and I think Wales as a result would suffer with lost jobs, lost investment.\" Other parties also criticised the decision with Jenny Willott, for the Liberal Democrats, saying Jobs Growth Wales had been \"ineffective\". \"However, for the Welsh Labour Government to allow this scheme to expire without replacing it is staggering,\" she said. And Ian Johnson, a Plaid Cymru election candidate, added: \"Earlier this year, Ed Miliband said how great the scheme was. \"Today, he has been embarrassed by his only government in the UK, who have fundamentally undermined his election pledge to young people.\" Meanwhile, UKIP's leader in Wales Nathan Gill called on ministers to \"focus on creating the right conditions for existing businesses to expand and for new businesses to start\". \"The only way we will ever truly achieve this is to withdraw from the European Union, which spends each day dreaming up new ways of stifling innovation and creativity in the form of regulations and directives,\" he said. But the Welsh government said it was aiming to launch a new Jobs Growth Wales programme in May saying it has made a \"significant contribution to reducing youth unemployment right across Wales\". \"The original programme was designed to create and fill 12,000 jobs and to date it has helped create over 17,000 job opportunities and fill almost 15,000 of these vacancies for young people aged 16-24,\" a spokesperson said. \"The European Social Fund budget for the 2007-2013 programme came to an end on 31 March and we have already begun work on the successor programme. \"Subject to approval within the new European Social Fund for 2014-2020 we are aiming to launch the new Jobs Growth Wales programme in the first quarter of this financial year.\" The thrust of the criticism here is that if Jobs Growth Wales is so important to the Welsh economy then how come it has been allowed to come to a halt, albeit temporarily, and how come funding has been reduced? The opposition parties have seized on developments partly because barely a week goes by without a member of the Welsh government trumpeting the success of its back-to-work scheme. The Welsh government insists it is not being scrapped and has responded to criticism over continuity by pointing to the fact that anyone about to begin or in the middle of a six-month placement will not be affected.

The Foxes are 17th this season and lost to League One Millwall in the FA Cup. \"It is very sad,\" said Match of the Day presenter Lineker. \"It is inexplicable to me. It's inexplicable to a lot football fans who love the game.\" Speaking to BBC Radio 4, the 56-year-old added: \"I suppose you can explain it in terms of a panic decision and for me a wrong decision. \"I shed a tear last night for Claudio, for football and for my club.\" After news of the 65-year-old Italian's dismissal broke on Thursday, former England captain Lineker, who played for his hometown club for seven seasons, said the \"game's gone\" in a post on social media. \"It's a sign of modern football, what happened last season was truly extraordinary, \" he added on Friday. \"The lack of gratitude from the owners of the club and who knows who else involved in such a decision beggars belief. \"That season will remain with us forever, it was truly special and a lot of that was down to the management. \"The same guy cannot be considered incapable of doing the job a few months months later after achieving what, for me, was the biggest miracle in sport.\" Chelsea dismissed Jose Mourinho as manager the season after their 2015 title and Lineker says while that is \"expected at big clubs\", the decision to sack Ranieri \"takes away from the glory\" for the Foxes. \"For a club like Leicester to win the league last season, the magnificence of the story, the likeability of the club under Ranieri - the ultimate gentleman - it kind of demeans the club. \"Leicester were hugely popular right around the world. To do something like this now loses a lot of that popularity.\" France midfielder N'Golo Kante moved to Chelsea for \u00a330m in the summer and Lineker said losing the 25-year-old was \"huge\". He added: \"There were a whole host of things that made the season fairly inevitable in the sense it would never be anything like last season. \"They had a journeyman back four that was protected brilliantly by Kante. They were an ageing back four, who are a year older. \"All of a sudden they were on pre-season tours, playing Barcelona, travelling all over the world. They were not prepared for the new season and then the confidence aspect sneaks in.\" Former Leicester and England goalkeeper Peter Shilton, said the club's struggles this season made Ranieri's sacking understandable. Speaking to Radio 4, he said: \"Going down would be a disaster for Leicester and I suppose the board have made a very brave decision. \"If they stay in the Premier League then they've made the right decision. A lot of people will say there's no sentiment in football, look at what he's done for the club, but he's had a lot of the season to get things going. \"There's obviously some reason why not. We're not privy to that - maybe the board are. Maybe there's unrest in the dressing room, who knows? Maybe the players just aren't performing.\" Leicester owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha used social media platform Instagram to explain why he sacked Ranieri. \"We have done our best as management, we do not have only one problem to solve, but there are a million things to do to make our club survive, \" the billionaire wrote. \"Please respect my decision, I will never let the club down\".

It has gone sour this term with players underperforming, new signings not working out and baffling tactics at time from the Tinkerman. \"I thought they would get relegated with Ranieri in charge. I hated to say it. I hoped it wouldn't come true and I'd be proved wrong. \"This gives them a chance. A different kind of chance to stay up.\" Phil McNulty, BBC chief football writer: It is almost the thought that dare not speak its name amid the wave of shock, outrage and disgust at Leicester's decision to ruthlessly dismiss the hugely popular 65-year-old, who won the hearts of all supporters with his good humour, class and dignity as he led the Foxes to the title. But is there actually method in what many see as the madness of the club's Thai owners? Leicester's fall has been more dramatic than anything they could have foreseen in their worst nightmares. A win for any of Sunderland, Crystal Palace and Hull City this weekend would put the Foxes in the relegation places. Wins for all three and they would be bottom by the time they face Liverpool on what will now be a highly charged occasion at the King Power on Monday. After 26 games last year they were top on 53 points, two ahead of Spurs. This season they are 17th after 25 games, with only 21 points. Last season they had lost only three games compared with 14 in this campaign, and conceded only 29 goals compared with 43 this term. Indeed, they only conceded 36 in the entire 2015-16 season. The difference is stark and, very clearly in the opinion of Leicester's owners, dangerous. Pat Murphy, BBC Radio 5 live I understand some influential players in the dressing room, who were part of the Nigel Pearson squad a couple of years ago, were making graphic contrasts with team spirit and the organisational qualities of Pearson compared with Ranieri this season. The club never really lost faith in Pearson this time two years ago. Despite the fact they were in the parlous position, the general feeling was that he had the dressing room and knew where he was going. He left in the summer of 2015 for different reasons - personal reasons associated with his son, who was on the staff. Quite clearly, Ranieri had lost a lot of key allies in that Leicester dressing room with long memories. On 7 February, Leicester issued a statement saying Ranieri had their \"unwavering support\". Sixteen days later they sacked the 65-year-old Italian, who had signed a new four-year deal in the summer. His departure came a day after the Foxes won praise for their performance despite losing 2-1 in their Champions League last-16 first-leg tie at Sevilla. \"Ranieri was told he was sacked on Thursday afternoon in Leicester once the team returned from Spain, but the suggestion is the owners decided before that defeat by Sevilla,\" said BBC sports editor Dan Roan. \"The decision was taken very reluctantly but the club's owners are desperate to avoid relegation and its consequences.\" Foxes vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha said: \"This has been the most difficult decision we have had to make in nearly seven years since King Power took ownership of Leicester City. \"But we are duty-bound to put the club's long-term interests above all sense of personal sentiment, no matter how strong that might be. \"Claudio has brought outstanding qualities to his office. His skilful management, powers of motivation and measured approach have been reflective of the rich experience we always knew he would bring to Leicester City.\" Srivaddhanaprabha added: \"His warmth, charm and charisma have helped transform perceptions of the club and develop its profile on a global scale. We will forever be grateful to him for what he has helped us to achieve. \"It was never our expectation that the extraordinary feats of last season should be replicated this season. Indeed, survival in the Premier League was our first and only target at the start of the campaign. \"But we are now faced with a fight to reach that objective and feel a change is necessary to maximise the opportunity presented by the final 13 games.\" A news conference with Leicester assistant manager Craig Shakespeare will take place at 13:00 GMT on Friday.

			"Input": "summarize: The Times reports that doctors in Kiev used a method called pronuclear transfer in what is a world first. It is not the first baby born with DNA from three parents, however. The baby girl, born on 5 January, is thought to be the world's second \"modern three-parent baby\" - another child was created using a slightly different method in Mexico last year. The Kiev team fertilised the mother's egg with her partner's sperm. They then transferred the combined genes into an egg taken from a donor. The child has the genetic identity of the parents, alongside a tiny amount of DNA from the second woman. Doctors developed three-person IVF to help women who are at risk of passing on serious genetic disorders, called mitochondrial disease, to have a healthy child. Eggs from a mother with unhealthy mitochondria and a donor with healthy mitochondria are collected. The Nadiya clinic in Kiev used the technique to treat an infertile couple, not a couple carrying a mitochondrial disease. UK experts said this was \"highly experimental\". Valery Zukin, who led the work, said they had a hunch it would work for the Ukrainian couple who had not been able to conceive with conventional IVF. He said he had a second patient - in a similar situation - who is expected to give birth in early March. The UK has already passed laws to allow three-person IVF for couples with mitochondrial diseases, although no such baby has been born in Britain yet. The science is new and controversial and raises ethical questions, including how any child from the technique might feel about having DNA from three people. Prof Adam Balen, chairman of the British Fertility Society, said: \"Pronuclear transfer is highly experimental and has not been properly evaluated or scientifically proven. \"We would be extremely cautious about adopting this approach to improve IVF outcomes.\"",

It was the greatest adventure of my life, and I survived it.\" Nick Yarris has never had an apology for being imprisoned for crimes he did not commit. He spent almost all that time in solitary confinement, sometimes being beaten so badly by prison guards that, on one occasion, his retina detached. \"The hardest thing to do when people are hurting you is to remain a decent person,\" he told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. While on death row, he educated himself about the law, and sometimes read up to three books in a day. \"The whole purpose of my education ultimately was so I could deliver a statement eloquently before my execution,\" he said. For 22 of the 23 years he spent in prison, Nick genuinely believed he would be executed. Nick has now written his own book about his life called \"The Fear of 13\", because he believed bad things happened to him around the 13th date. \"I didn't mind the 23 hours a day solitary confinement for the majority of the time, because after the first few years in prison, when I stopped being angry and started to like myself and understand myself, it was OK. I still enjoy my own company sometimes. \"I've never had any psychiatric help since leaving prison. I studied psychology in there and applied it to myself.\" Nick grew up in a suburb of Philadelphia with his parents and five siblings, but his happy childhood was shattered when, aged seven, he was attacked by a teenage boy who hit him on the head so hard it gave him brain damage and then raped him. He did not tell his parents. The trauma of this assault led his behaviour into a downward spiral and as he got older he began drinking and taking drugs. He was arrested, aged 20, after being accused of the attempted kidnap and murder of a police officer - a charge of which he was later acquitted. But while in custody before that trial, Nick was desperate to get out and so made up a story, telling police he knew who committed the murder of a woman, Linda Mae Craig, who he had only read about in the newspaper and had never met. \"I was just desperate, a drug-addled kid who didn't know what to do to get out of jail.\" He said the murderer was a man with whom he once briefly lived. Nick thought the man - who had stolen money from him - had later died and so believed he could safely trade this false information for his own freedom. However, the man Nick accused was still alive and the lie was exposed. The police then charged Nick with these crimes instead. In 1982, he was convicted of the woman's rape and murder and sent to death row. During his imprisonment in Pennsylvania jails, Nick's only possessions were a couple of paper sacks full of legal materials, some novels, toiletries and a small radio. He was only allowed to exercise for 30 minutes on weekdays in a small cage. He would spend 14 years, from 1989 to 2003, without being touched by another human being. During this time, he would lie on his arm until it went numb and then use it to rub his face, as though it were someone else. In 1988 he became the first man on death row in the United States to ask for DNA testing, but this led to years of heartbreaking delays and churning frustrations, such as when a vital package containing DNA samples burst open when it was posted to a laboratory, destroying the evidence. Eventually, Nick sought the most extreme form of relief from his imprisonment. \"In 2002 I was ready to be executed and I asked to drop my legal appeals so that the execution process would be carried out.\" But then a judge ordered one final round of DNA testing and evidence came back and cleared him in 2003, demonstrating that there were DNA traces of two unknown men in the car and on Linda's clothing. Linda's killer has never been found and Nick received compensation for his wrongful conviction, although it \"feels like pity money\" to him. \"When I got out, I got a mantra from my mother, who sat me down and said that I had to be a polite and kind man from now on and that I had to be kind to women, otherwise it was a waste of coming home. \"She did me a huge favour. I began creating positive passages in my brain that changed my thoughts for the better.\" He also said that when he got out, he noticed how \"people weren't as reserved as they were\". \"In prison you're not allowed to give out your opinion. But now everyone's expected to give their opinion on social media.\" He now campaigns for the abolishment of the death penalty, has spoken in front of officials at both the United Nations and European Union and has given around 300 talks in schools. And it was a trip to the UK, to speak to MPs in Parliament, that led him to fall in love with England, where he has lived since 2005. \"It felt like a permanent holiday away from my woes,\" he said. Now a father and living in Ilchester, Somerset, he recently saw a photo from his own childhood, showing 27 children from his neighbourhood in the 1970s. He is the only one still alive, the others dying through drugs, car accidents or violence. Both his brothers died because of drugs and alcohol abuse. He added: \"I see my prison past as an old movie I watched that scarred me, but now I don't get so bothered about it. \"If I hadn't have gone to prison, then my life wouldn't be as good as it is now. I never look at it in a negative way.\" The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.

At least eight people were seriously injured by the lightning strike early on Saturday morning. Central Europe has been hit by severe storms and rain over the past few weeks, leading to 11 deaths in Germany. The Rock am Ring festival - one of the most popular of its kind in Germany - also suffered lightning strikes last year, when 33 people were taken to hospital. The festival website has repeatedly warned fans of the possibility of strong rainfall and thunderstorms. The organisers of Rock am Ring, now in its 31st year, initially said on Saturday that this year's event would continue. It was due to have finished on Sunday evening. Red Hot Chili Peppers were among several bands, including Black Sabbath, Foals, Deftones and We Are Scientists, who were on the line-up. Last weekend, 35 people were injured, three seriously, when lightning struck a football match in south-west Germany. A further 11 people were hurt by a lightning strike in a Paris park where a children's birthday party was taking place.",

More than 80 people died when a lorry struck crowds celebrating Bastille Day on 14 July. So-called Islamic State (IS) said it was behind the attack, which was carried out by a Tunisian man, Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel. Ms Bertin told the Journal du Dimanche (in French) she had been instructed by an interior ministry official to report the presence of national police units on the seaside Promenade des Anglais at the time of the attack. \"The national police were perhaps there, but I couldn't see them on the video,\" Ms Bertin said. She told the Journal du Dimanche she had also been \"harassed for an hour\" by Mr Cazeneuve on the phone. The interior ministry says there were 64 members of the national police on the seafront - as per arrangements with Nice city hall. But the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says Nice city hall believes some of these national police had been replaced by municipal police -  who were more lightly armed and less able to intervene to stop the killer. The suspicion - denied vehemently in Paris - is that there has been a cover-up, our correspondent says. Mr Cazeneuve said he would sue for defamation over the \"grave accusations\". The government has faced criticism for not preventing the attack, at a time when France was in a state of emergency following the extremist attacks in Paris in November last year. French ministers were booed when they attended a ceremony in Nice to remember the victims. President Francois Hollande said on Friday he had \"full confidence\" in Mr Cazeneuve. Last week, local authorities in Nice refused a request by French anti-terror police to destroy CCTV images of the attack. The Paris prosecutor's office said the request had been made to avoid the \"uncontrolled dissemination\" of images. But officials in Nice responded by filing a legal document, arguing the footage could constitute evidence.",

			"Input": "summarize: A report commissioned by Food Standards Scotland found that in-store promotions were heavily weighted in favour of food with high levels of salt or sugar. The Stirling University academics behind the report called for a \"retail revolution\" to help people choose healthier options. However, the study was criticised by the Scottish Grocers' Federation. It said the report failed to take account of the efforts already being made to promote healthy eating. Food Standards Scotland (FSS) said Scottish obesity levels, currently 30%, were projected to rise to 40% by 2030. Professor Leigh Sparks, who wrote the report, told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that there was an imbalance in the type of food promoted in shops. \"If you look at the environment in store in retailing, then most of the promotions are pushing the products that are less healthy for consumers,\" he said. \"A lot of the products have been supersized as well - boxes of crisps, bags of crisps are good examples of that.\" He said that manufacturers needed to make changes to the composition of their products, while retailers should provide more information for consumers and change their \"balance of promotions\". \"I think retailers are increasingly aware of the issue and they're looking at what they can do,\" he added. \"But most of the voluntary schemes that have gone on so far have not had the impact because of this overwhelming tide in terms of unhealthy promotions as well.\" The report also backs the idea of a sugar tax. FSS senior dietary adviser Dr Gillian Purdon said: \"The report supports Food Standards Scotland views and recommendations for the need to extend sugar tax beyond soft drinks, to reformulate products to reduce sugar fat and salt, to resize portions, address less healthy food promotion and to provide clearer consumer information on products in both the retail and out of home sectors. \"This report will help us to develop new approaches to improve the balance of food offered and promoted by the retail sector. \"It is clear that a combination of measures will be needed overall to enable healthier eating. Regulation of promotions of high fat, salt and/or sugar food and drink within retail stores and out of home premises should be taken forward as a priority.\" Previous research by FSS indicated about 50% of less healthy food choices are purchased on promotions. For healthier foods, the figure is about 30%. The report added: \"We conclude that the current context for consumer choice in-store is affecting the health and diet of consumers in Scotland. \"Voluntary and self-regulatory approaches or relying on consumers to make 'good' decisions are not having sufficient impact. \"It will thus be necessary to regulate to make the changes have real impact.\" Dr John Lee, of the Scottish Grocers' Federation, which represents food retailers in Scotland, said: \"This report seems to ignore the significant efforts of retailers to actively promote healthy products in-store and the efforts of manufacturers to reformulate products and reduce calories. \"Additionally, extending the sugar tax will make no real or lasting impact on diet-related problems. Improved food education and awareness should be the priority rather than constantly shifting the responsibility for population health onto retailers.\" SGF said more than 200 stores were participating in its Scottish government-supported Healthy Living Programme. The Scottish Retail Consortium said its members were committed to helping consumers make healthier choices and called for \"regulation or legislation\" on the issue. Ewan MacDonald-Russell, its head of policy, said: \"Fruit and vegetables are heavily price promoted and there has been a proliferation of healthy alternatives. Just as importantly, our industry has led the way on reformulating products to reduce salt, sugar and fats from products, and in producing clearer and more informative labelling. \"It's worth highlighting the number of products being promoted in total is falling in response to customer demands for simpler pricing. We will continue to engage directly with FSS and the Scottish government on this issue. However, any measures on pricing and promotions will have to be done through regulation or legislation; it's not feasible, or legal, to ask retailers to voluntarily take collective measures in this area. \"Ultimately however, the best way to help improve Scotland's health is for government to take steps to ensure the whole food and drink industry is working collectively, on a level playing field, to ensure no matter where customers shop or consume they are able to make healthy informed choices.\"",

Gourmet Burger Kitchen, founded in 2001, was a \"pioneer of the premium burger revolution\", Famous Brands said. The company says that it wants to open 10 to 15 more burger restaurants a year in the UK. The mass-market burger giants, McDonalds and Burger King, first opened in the UK in the 1970s. While those brands have continued to expand, by the end of the 1990s a new fashion for more expensive burgers had arrived, again from the US. Upmarket burger brands in the UK now include Byron, Shake Shack and Five Guys, as well as an increasing number of independents. According to analysts Mintel, the premium burger market now accounts for sales worth more than \u00a33bn a year. Famous Brands plans to double Gourmet Burger Kitchen's 75 UK stores in the next five years and said Brexit uncertainty would not affect its plans. Consumers still want food that is quick and convenient, but are willing to pay for better ingredients, said Famous Brands' Kevin Hedderwick. \"The fast-casual premium environment is pretty recession-proof,\" he said. The price difference between upmarket and fast-food burger shops is quite striking. Whereas a typical McDonald's quarter-pounder with cheese will set you back less than \u00a33, a Gourmet Burger Kitchen 4oz classic cheeseburger is more than \u00a36. But Gourmet Burger Kitchen also sells more unusual fare, including buffalo burgers and Persian lamb. Food fashions in the UK range from the super-health-conscious to the indulgent. And at the indulgent end of the scale, consumers are focusing on the quality of the ingredients and being able to personalise the menu, by selecting different options. \"Consumers see freshly made burgers as the biggest marker of a gourmet burger venue, something that sets them apart, as this is not traditionally offered by fast food venues,\" said Kiti Soininen, head of UK food and drink research at Mintel. \"Customisation is also a top expectation for gourmet offerings, in line with a more general demand for knowing what goes into one's food and the trend for personalisation.\"",

The watchdog inspected 22 schools in England which had previously been inspected by the Bridge Schools Inspectorate. Inspectors found that nine of these schools were inadequate. Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw has written to Education Secretary Nicky Morgan with the findings of inspections of 15 Muslim and seven Christian schools, in cities including Manchester, Coventry, Birmingham and Leicester. Previous checks of these private faith schools had been carried out by the Bridge Schools Inspectorate (BSI),  an independent inspectorate which had inspected about 50 private Muslim and Christian schools. Independent schools do not come under the same Ofsted process as state schools, with inspections being carried out by independent agencies such as the Independent Schools Inspectorate and the School Inspection Service. Ofsted had raised concerns about the \"quality of BSI inspection\" and, this autumn, Ofsted took over its inspection responsibilities. One school in this current wave of Ofsted inspections - Manchester Islamic High School for Girls - was rated outstanding. But Sir Michael's letter highlights a range of concerns about other schools previously inspected by BSI. Four of the schools were assessed not to be \"promoting fundamental British values\". This included not promoting \"mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs\". There were concerns about a lack of exposure to other religions and \"inappropriate\" books. At Al Ameen primary school in Birmingham, inspectors say pupils were not protected from reading \"inappropriate literature about extremist, sexist or partisan views\". Inspectors said that at Darul Uloom Islamic High School in Birmingham, \"the only female governor sat out of sight of the male governors in an adjacent room to the main meeting. \"As a result, she could only contribute to the meeting through a doorway. Governors told inspectors this was their usual arrangement. \"A senior HMI has pointed out to the school that this practice is unacceptable as it fails to show proper respect for women.\" This school, now rated as inadequate, had been inspected by Ofsted inspectors since 2011. In October 2013, Ofsted rated it as good and described the head teacher as \"forward thinking\". Ofsted says that although its own inspectors carried out a number of inspections in recent years, the school was considered to have been part of the BSI inspection system. In Cornerstone School in Epsom, a private Christian school, Ofsted said pupils were \"not given sufficient opportunities to learn about different cultures and the perspectives of others\". There were eight schools where there were safeguarding concerns, including \"not paying due regard to the guidance issued in 'Keeping children safe in education', a lack of checks on staff or insufficient records on pupil attendance. And in a further 10 cases there were concerns about schools not providing a sufficiently broad curriculum. Sir Michael's letter to the education secretary says it should be a priority to inspect other former BSI schools.",

Although regulations and an asbestos problem might make buying the school difficult, he said the company will work with the school board to come up with a solution that works, and intends to help cover some costs. \"Somebody's got to step to the plate and somebody's got to help fix the situation,\" he said. Mr Chapman proposed buying the building and leasing it back to the school board at a reasonable rate in order to keep the school open. But the aging building could require millions of dollars worth of repairs, and regulations make it tricky for a private company to buy a public building still intended for public use. \"Essentially what we were proposing was a giant band aid to delay the situation,\" he said. The school is one of about 600 - many in rural areas - that the province has earmarked to be shut down in order to save costs. If Beavercrest were to close, children from the town would have to spend up to 90 minutes in a bus commuting to one of three other schools in the area.

Debra Milke, then a 25-year-old insurance company clerk, was accused of dressing her son in his favourite outfit and telling him he was going to see Santa Claus at a local mall. Four-year-old Christoper Milke was then taken by two men to a desert area north of Phoenix where he was shot three times in the head. The original trial in 1990 found Ms Milke guilty of arranging the killing, based largely on an alleged confession made to Detective Armando Saldate. However, Mr Saldate did not record the confession and has since been implicated in several cases of misconduct including lying under oath. An appeals court ruled last year that prosecutors had known about Mr Saldate's misconduct but failed to disclose the information. \"Non-disclosure of this magnitude calls into question the integrity of the system and was highly prejudicial to Milke,\" the court said. Mr Saldate said he feared potential charges if he testified again, and in December a judge granted his request not to give evidence at any retrial. The court said on Thursday that it wasn't expressing an opinion on Milke's guilt or innocence but merely on the validity of a retrial. Ms Milke's ex-husband, Arizona Milke, remained convinced of her guilt. \"She shouldn't walk free, because she's guilty,\" he told the Associated Press. Lawyers for Ms Milke said they were \"thrilled\" at the decision not to allow a retrial. However, prosecutors can still appeal to the state's Supreme Court.",

David Cameron cannot be accused of inconsistency on this issue. He said exactly the same in 2010. Perhaps they should agree that it's the most important general election since the last one. Owen Smith made his remarks in Ammanford as Labour launched its Welsh campaign in a seat it lost to Plaid Cymru in 2001. Labour used the launch to unveil its Welsh campaign pledge card (above). These cards have become an essential campaign tool since John Prescott took to his battlebus in 1997. Not for the first time at these gatherings, I asked the obvious question of the politicians, candidates and activists present: how many of the five pledges can you name? Some of the replies were more on message than others. One sticker-wearing supporter was honest: \"Oh, not many....I haven't read it yet.\" His friend got closer: \"The bedroom tax is going to go...more money for the NHS? That is very important.\" Once candidate told me: \"I don't know....let me see...I knew you were going to ask me that......I haven't actually seen it yet.\" So I thought I'd try asking Welsh Labour leader, Carwyn Jones: \"Well if you look at the pledges, they are UK pledges. They are pledges around UK issues as you know. What we've got to be careful about is to make sure the pledges affect the UK and not just of course Wales.\" Pressed, he mentioned the living wage, looking at improving the economy and helping people live in safer communities.

			"Input": "summarize: His aim was to give children in rural areas an access to education. As a member of non-profit organisation e-Education Project, he travelled across the country for the next year. \"I filmed some of the best teachers' classes in big cities, burned them onto DVDs and showed them to students in rural areas,\" he says. He chose DVDs because internet connection was hard to come by. In the first year, Doga visited more than 700 students in five schools. The examination results at those schools improved by 46%. \"In developed countries, kids complain about having to do homework, but these Rwandan children were thrilled to be able to learn, which made me happy.\" During one of his trips, he noticed piles of food that were in storage. Farmers were too poor to transport them to big cities. Through United Nations workers whom he met in Rwanda, Mr Makiura decided to facilitate the transport of food between the farmers and hundreds of thousands of refugees who were fleeing the civil war in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo. That was less than two years ago. Today, he is based in Bangkok where he has started his own company. His passion remains the same: to raise the living standards of people in developing countries. This time he's doing it through a mobile phone application called Personal Data Bank. The app is still in the early-development stage, but the aim is to build a more efficient infrastructure by analysing the locations of people who are using the app. Mr Makiura is an atypical Japanese youth. Above all, he is not afraid to take risks. And his global vision and entrepreneurial spirit are exactly what the Japanese government wants to encourage. Today, Japan has one of the lowest levels of entrepreneurship in the developed world, according to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor. There are a number of obstacles. Japan has long lacked venture capitalists who tend to invest in start-ups elsewhere in the world. And approaching banks for financing help, is a big challenge for entrepreneurs. \"I asked for funding through traditional financial institutions but they wanted to see balance sheets which we don't have,\" says Naoki Mita, who left his banking job to open detox spa Le Furo. Mr Mita approached Mr Makiura and asked for him to be an adviser to the spa venture. And together, they managed to secure funding from investors abroad. But Mr Mita believes not many entrepreneurs would even consider raising money overseas. \"Thanks to my experience as an investment banker I could look outside Japan, but at home the gap between demand and supply in the capital market is severe,\" he says. But the fundamental problem lies deeper in people's perspectives. In a society that appreciates a conformist attitude, not following the usual path of becoming a salaryman - a company employee -  is seen as too risky or even reckless. The former boss of the once high-flying internet firm, Livedoor, Takafumi Horie challenged that view in the 1990s. Instead of graduating from elite Tokyo University and looking for a job, he dropped out and started his own firm. \"I couldn't care less about what people thought of me,\" he tells the BBC. \"I had no desire to become a salaryman or wear a suit,\" adds Mr Horie, who stood out in the conservative world of corporate Japan by wearing T-shirts to business meetings. Under his leadership, Livedoor grew rapidly. He also made headlines by trying to buy a baseball team and running in a parliamentary election. But in 2006, Mr Horie was charged with securities fraud and imprisoned for 21 months before he was released on parole. He has maintained his innocence and accused the prosecution of targeting him for his brash, unconventional entrepreneurship. His arrest became known as the \"Horie shock\" and regardless of their beliefs about his guilt, other entrepreneurs from then on kept a low profile. The support for start-ups that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has announced is a turning point in people's perspectives. Today, there are more venture capital companies to help start-ups. The number of entrepreneurs is on the rise. \"What's lacking now is the true venture capitalist spirit - not just injecting capital but mentoring and helping the next generation grow,\" says special advisor to the Cabinet Office William Saito, adding that the government is trying to encourage that. But Mr Makiura says many of his peers are still trying to get a job with big listed companies. He says he is who he is today because when he was just 13, he decided to leave the comfort of home to study in the UK. He wanted to see the world outside Japan. Mr Horie says the whole education system needs to change, because at the moment, it is only producing loyal soldiers who are good at following orders. Half a century ago, Japan did produce a number of great entrepreneurs. They were the founders of Toyota, Sony and Honda who were unafraid to try something different. But as the economy grew, Mr Saito says, the Japanese society became unforgiving towards failures, and this needs to change. People like Mr Makiura are still too rare. But Japanese youths who are unafraid to take risks may be the best way to jump start the Japanese economy.",

Those rights would be in jeopardy if Britain voted to leave. Reality Check Verdict: The EU has been influential in the development of equality legislation but leaving would not necessarily mean those rights would be lost. The Treaty of Rome included the commitment for member states to ensure \"that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work\". And the rules were strengthened following the 1975 Equal Pay Directive, and subsequent rulings by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which have set out further what counts as equal work. Similarly, the right of part-time workers to join occupational pension schemes was determined by rulings of the ECJ, which found that excluding them constituted indirect sex discrimination. If Britain leaves the EU those rules could, in principle, be revoked. However, in some cases the UK government has gone further than the rules set by the EU. For example, the 52 weeks of statutory maternity leave in the UK is considerably longer than the 14 weeks guaranteed by EU law. Leave campaigners say there's no reason to suppose that a future British government would undermine women's rights. But Ms Harman believes that many of the people leading the campaign for Brexit - including Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Iain Duncan Smith - cannot be trusted to protect women's rights.

			"Input": "summarize: \"I have been asked in my younger years to consider joining, and I just never felt ready or prepared,\" said Ms Seifert, who started working as a model at the age of 14 and later worked as a television presenter. But the moment finally arrived in 2009, after she had finished a nursing degree in New York. At the age of 25 - the limit for most pageants - time was running out. Ms Seifert trained for over a month at a so-called beauty camp, setting her sights on representing the Philippines at the Miss Universe competition. But she said pageant organisers disqualified her days before the finals over bikini photos published in a men's magazine. Undaunted, she decided to take part in another national pageant weeks later. Not only did she win the national Miss Earth title, she went on to compete in the international pageant, where she was crowned runner-up out of 80 competitors from all over the world. Beauty pageants have been popular in the Philippines since they were brought to the country by the American colonial government in the first half of the 20th Century, says Jose Wendell Capili, an academic at the University of the Philippines in the capital, Manila. Opposition from feminists, if there is any, is muted. The recent successes of candidates in international competitions have heightened interest even further. Mr Capili, who wrote a book about Philippine pageants, says that as a result, pageants have become more competitive. \"In the old days, an untrained candidate may end up winning a title either because she is a great beauty or is someone from a pedigreed family,\" he said. \"These days, there are talent scouts and modelling agencies who actually train some of the girls, months, even years, before the national competition.\" One of the most successful beauty camps is headed by Jonas Gaffud, who is CEO of a large modelling agency, Mercator. He and a teams of mentors field an average of 10 candidates a year. The mentors work for free, and many of the women dominate the national pageants and go on to place well internationally. Mr Gaffud is credited with helping Megan Young win the first Miss World crown for the Philippines in 2013. His team's beauty queens have also been finalists in every Miss Universe pageant since 2010. Some have also placed in previous Miss World and Miss International finals. In scouting a potential candidate, Mr Gaffud said that height - at least five feet five inches tall (165.1cm) - and \"the beauty of face\" were most important. But training was just as important. He said candidates need to start training at least six months before a competition. This included studying the pageant's cause, learning how to walk on stage, knowing how to do hair and make-up, exercising to tone the physique and practicing how to answer questions, he said. Ms Seifert, who trained at another beauty camp, said that the hours spent training were intense. \"There are different exercises that you do, all the way from head to toe. Stretching, neck rotations, really tough waist movements to shape your waist,\" she said. One exercise was called the \"duck walk\" and involved walking in circles in a bikini at a dance studio lined with mirrors. \"Just imagine doing lunges in high heels with a book or several books on your head - and they cannot fall,\" she said. And despite her previous experience as a television host, she still received coaching for the pageant Q&A, as well as advice from former pageant winners. Like Ms Seifert, Sian Elizabeth Maynard also trained at a beauty camp before taking part in a national pageant, even after successfully winning three local titles. She did calisthenics exercises and walking training, which included \"doing weird lunges and wiggling\". Sian Elizabeth Maynard, now 27, did not really want to join beauty pageants. But she says her mum \"begged me to, so I joined a local one\". She joined three local pageants a year from 2007 to 2009 - two in Cebu province in central Philippines and one national pageant - and won all titles. She was one of 10 finalists in Miss Philippines-Earth in 2010. They were not all pleasant experiences. Once, some of the candidates' sashes - which must be worn at all times in the competition - went missing. Replacements were quickly made, but some women ended up wearing their sashes even while brushing their teeth. Ms Maynard slept with hers under her pillow. \"In other pageants, someone would cut the strap of a bikini or the strap of a sandal,\" she said. \"The number one rule is that you have to watch your belongings because there could be a lot of theft, like make-up and cell phones go missing,\" Ms Maynard said. But she had good memories too, and said she made many friends. She learned how to dress up and present herself, when before joining she \"didn't even know or bother to comb my hair\". \"So when we do these lunges, and we wiggle our hips, it's really tiresome. And we all do this in four-inch heels minimum. It helps us to lengthen our stride and to put more sway in our hips,\" Ms Maynard said. Sometimes she had to do the high-heeled lunges while answering questions called out by her mentors. \"And then, every so often while we're doing it, one of them [trainers] would just call out a question, like you know, 'If you had to take out an element out the universe, which element would it be and why? Earth, wind, fire or water?' \"It's really not just about smiling and standing in front of people. It's a lot of hard work,\" said Ms Maynard, now 27. Even the tiny details matter, Mr Gaffud said. He helps pick the right outfits and involves himself with how a candidate \"should sway on stage\". He even helps pick a candidate's lipstick shade - anything to help improve her chances. He said mentors tried to build on a candidate's natural traits, such as whether to cultivate a sweet or sexy image. Some mentors do charge for their services, but most like Mr Gaffud do it \"for the love of finding a girl\". \"This is a side project,\" he said, adding that mentors help pay for the candidate's make-up, pictorials, food and sometimes even their rent. Some mentors, however, go on to manage their beauty queen's careers after they are successful in pageants. \"They don't expect us to pay for anything, which I just find really amazing,\" said Ms Seifert, \"because these pageant aficionados have full-time jobs, but they really dedicate so much of themselves to helping us develop and train,\" she said. Becoming a beauty queen is not always glamorous, Ms Seifert cautioned. \"The moment I got crowned was the moment all the hard work began,\" she said. In her case, being a Miss Philippines-Earth winner and Miss Earth runner-up meant many public appearances to promote environmental causes. Pageant winners have high public profiles in the Philippines, and winning a title is seen as coming with big responsibilities. As \"an important public figure\", it was important to set a good example to young girls who looked up to beauty queens, Ms Seifert said. Winners are feted, introduced to high-ranking officials, and often recognised on the street and asked to pose for photographs. Anjo Lorenzana, a lecturer from the Ateneo de Manila University who specialises in media and popular culture, said pageants were also an opportunity for the Philippines to promote its image on an international stage. \"By winning international beauty contests, Filipinos, who are usually equated with lowly occupations, can be seen in a better light,\" he said. For the candidates, pageants can be a stepping stone for upward social or economic mobility, Jose Wendell Capili said. He added that Filipinos were deeply passionate about pageants, pointing to heated online discussions. \"Rooting for a particular candidate can sometimes break up families, friendships and relationships,\" he said. Tammy David, who has been photographing pageants since 2007, said the most unusual pageant she shot was inside a large jail. \"You could see how parents were proud because their daughter was Little Miss Bureau of Corrections,\" Ms David said. \"Beauty pageants are everywhere.\"",

A Remarkable Life covers everything from his birth in Tibet in 1939 to his murder in China in 2013. Shortly before his death, he authorised the film to be made which was given its premiere in southern Scotland. Akong Rinpoche was installed as abbot of a monastery in eastern Tibet at the age of just four having been identified as the reincarnation of the previous abbot. When he was 19, with China having occupied Tibet and tensions between the countries at their height, he joined a freedom walk over the Himalayas to India. It took 10 months and of the 200 people who started, only 15 survived. Akong eventually made his way to the UK in 1959 and acquired an old farmhouse at Eskdalemuir where Samye Ling was founded in 1967. The film's executive producer Vin Harris told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"I think they travelled around lots of places, there was a story that it kind of reminded them of Tibet. \"There was someone there who was running a spiritual centre and he was ready to move on so they basically took it over. \"They were very much welcomed, particularly in Dumfries, Rinpoche made his family life there and had very good friends here.\" Samye Ling was the first Buddhist monastery to be founded in Europe and students later included David Bowie and Leonard Cohen. It has now grown into a large complex for the study and teaching of Buddhism, with a vast temple at its heart. From there, Akong spearheaded a range of projects including  ROKPA International, which carries out humanitarian work in Tibet, Nepal, India and Africa. It was while in China in October 2013 that he was murdered, aged 73, but before his death he authorised the film of his life to be made. Its premiere at Samye Ling was attended by the current abbot, Akong's younger brother Lama Yeshe Losal Rinpoche. \"We feel that the film is more a message of hope actually - a celebration of his life,\" Mr Harris said. \"It kind of focuses on the fact that putting compassion into action, rather than being a kind of luxury, is so effective. \"We look at what, as a refugee, he achieved - setting up centres all over the world and helping thousands and thousands of people without compromising that value of compassion.\"",

Supplies of medicine and blood are running low, as a three-week siege by the army begins to have an impact. An air strike on a pumping station has also left many areas without water. \"The planes are not leaving the skies at all,\" Brita Hagi Hassan, president of the rebel city council, told Reuters news agency. \"Life in the city is paralysed.\" \"Everyone is cooped up in their homes, sitting in the basements. These missiles are even targeting the basements and shelters that we'd set up to protect people.\" Aleppo, once Syria's largest city and the country's commercial and industrial hub, has been divided roughly in two since 2012, with President Bashar al-Assad's forces controlling the west and rebel factions the east. In the past year, troops have gradually broken the deadlock with the help of Iranian-backed militias and Russian air strikes. Earlier this month, they severed the rebels' last route into the east and placed its 250,000 residents under siege. A short-lived truce brokered by the US and Russia provided them with a brief respite, but its collapse last Monday led to the Syrian military launching an offensive to take full control of the city. Since then, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has documented the deaths of 248 people in rebel-held parts of Aleppo and its surrounding countryside. Dozens of air strikes overnight killed 12 people, including three children, the UK-based monitoring group reported on Monday. Bebars Mishal, a rescue worker from the Syria Civil Defence, alleged that aircraft were \"using all kinds of weapons - phosphorus and napalm and cluster bombs\". The US, UK and France, which back the rebels, have also accused Syrian government and Russian forces of using bunker-busting bombs to destroy underground shelters, dropping incendiary weapons indiscriminately on civilian areas, and targeting war pumping stations. Aref al-Aref, an intensive care medial worker, said hospitals in rebel-held Aleppo were \"overwhelmed with wounded people\" and that \"things are starting to run out\". \"We are unable to bring anything in... not equipment and not even medical staff. Some medical staff are in the countryside, unable to come in because of the siege,\" he told Reuters. Abd Arrahman Alomar, a paediatrician who works for the Syrian American Medical Society, warned there were only 30 doctors still inside eastern Aleppo and that there was only enough fuel to run hospital generators for 20 days. The charity Save the Children meanwhile reported that one of the main hospitals still operating in the area was directly hit with a barrel bomb on Monday. Rescue efforts have also been hampered by the reported destruction of three Syria Civil Defence fire engines and two ambulances in air strikes in the past week. Several charity kitchens were also closed on Monday because of the violence, while an AFP news agency correspondent said food prices had risen significantly. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters that President Obama was \"deeply concerned\" by the \"sickening\" bloodshed in Aleppo and elsewhere in Syria. \"What we have seen from the Assad regime and the Russians is a concerted campaign to strike civilian targets, to bomb civilians into submission,\" he said. But a Syrian military source insisted it had no intention of letting up, telling AFP: \"The air force will bomb any terrorist movements, this is an irreversible decision.\"",

China has \"absolutely recognised that it is a problem of overcapacity in their country\", Mr Javid said. However, China rejected suggestions that it subsidised its loss-making steel companies, and the meeting ended without any formal agreement. Nevertheless, Mr Javid said China is \"committing to do something about it and I think that's a very positive step forward\". He said it was the first time all the major steel-producing nations had come together with the industry to discuss the issue of excess capacity. Mr Javid admitted that there was no \"overnight solution\" to the issue of excess production: \"The discussion today with all these countries coming together is something that we pushed for, and ... China's participation will help make the difference.\" Chinese steel output rose in March, according to official figures released last week, despite repeated pledges to cut capacity. Ministers and trade officials, including from the US and India, as well as the World Trade Organisation, World Steel Association and the private sector attended Monday's meeting, which was organised by the OECD. Mari Kiviniemi, OECD deputy secretary-general, said there was \"very strong willingness\" to hold further talks, with some countries wanting to take more \"concrete steps\". Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, said: \"We appear to be no closer to finding international action to put in place solutions. This is a global problem which requires a global solution to remove current over-capacity and time is a luxury we don't have.\" He called on China to take the same radical action that European steel producers had embraced. Earlier, China's official news agency said that blaming the country for the global steel industry's problems was a \"lame and lazy excuse for protectionism\". Xinhua said in an English-language commentary piece: \"Blaming other countries is always an easy, sure-fire way for politicians to whip up a storm over domestic economic woes, but finger-pointing and protectionism are counter-productive. The last thing the world needs is a trade war over this issue. Far more jobs will be lost than gained if protectionism prevails.\" EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem told the meeting the steel crisis was \"now life or death for many companies\", but that tariffs were \"only a short-term bandage\", adding: \"Healing the sector's wounds requires sustained international cooperation leading to effective reform.\" The internal market and industry commissioner, Elzbieta Bienkowska, said the European Union should consider allowing member nations to subsidise their steel industries. \"We have to discuss whether we can't be more flexible in our judgment of state aid,\" she told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. \"We cannot push this industry any further.\" 63.7bn tonnes in 2015 67.5% used in 2015 70.9% used in 2014 The steel crisis has put thousands of UK jobs under threat at plants including Port Talbot in south Wales. Tata Steel said last month that it was selling its unprofitable UK plants. The company has blamed factors including high energy costs and China \"dumping\" steel on the global market. Britain's steel industry: What's going wrong? Roy Rickhuss, leader of the Community union, said the meeting was more concerned with the long term, rather than immediate action to save the UK industry. \"Today's meeting seemed to be all about long-term challenges. While these issues do need addressing, what we need is urgent short-term action from governments across Europe and beyond to get us through the current crisis and create a sustainable future for steel.\" The Government has come under pressure to rescue Port Talbot and has been urged to consider part-nationalising the industry. Mr Javid said parties interested in Tata's UK assets had started to come forward: \"It's too early to say much about them at this stage but the important thing is, as we said all along, we will do everything we can to help with that sales process. The steel workers of Britain deserve nothing less.\" The business secretary said that EY had been appointed to act as financial advisers on behalf of the Government, which was \"committed to doing all it can to ensure a sustainable future for the UK steel industry\". Tata has also appointed Standard Chartered bank as an additional adviser. The Indian group said on Monday that Bimlendra Jha has been appointed to the new role of chief executive of Tata Steel UK.

After London, more Arket stores will follow in Brussels, Copenhagen and Munich, and the new brand will be launched online. The new stores will also stock external brands, and some outlets will include a cafe offering Scandinavian-style food. Bernadette Kissane, apparel and footwear analyst at Euromonitor International, said on paper the plan looked \"promising\". \"The company's results have been falling short of expectations recently, consistently outpaced by key rival Inditex,\" she said. \"Rather than adopt a faster sourcing strategy to compete, the company has opted to introduce new brand Arket to effectively cater to shifts in consumer behaviour.\" H&M already operates a range of High Street brands including Cos, & Other Stories, Monki, Weekday and Cheap Monday.

H&M pioneered fast fashion alongside Zara's owner Inditex. But Inditex has overtaken H&M in recent years to become the world's largest fashion retailer. The company's profits are also being squeezed by online competition from retailers such as Asos, which offer a fast turnover of fashion styles in response to customer demand. \"Retail is going through a challenging period of change in which customers' shopping behaviour and expectations are changing at a fast pace as a result of growing digitalisation,\" said H&M's chief executive Karl-Johan Persson in a statement accompanying the firm's latest financial results. \"For fashion retail in general, market conditions were very tough in many of our large markets in central and southern Europe and in the US, and this was reflected in our sales,\" he added.

			"Input": "summarize: The websites you visit often track where you came from and watch where you head off to next. A VPN - or virtual private network - helps you browse the internet more anonymously by routing your traffic through a server that is not your point of origin. It is a bit like switching cars to shake off someone who is tailing you. There are plenty of companies offering services with varying degrees of security and varying degrees of cost, but if you are willing to roll your sleeves up and get technical with some basic coding and a \u00a330 Raspberry Pi computer, you can build your own VPN server at home. It won't give you the option of appearing to be from somewhere else but you can use it to connect external devices like a smartphone to browse the internet more securely through your home network, and access shared files and media on your home computer. Make no mistake, this is not a quick and easy process. On BBC Click I have shared some tips from my own experience setting up a DIY VPN server. Below is a step-by-step guide you will need to follow to the letter, symbol and space if you want to follow in my footsteps. To follow this guide you will need: Prepare to install your operating system Insert the micro SD card in your card reader. If you are reusing an old SD card make sure it is fully formatted to remove any old files using the free tool at http://sdcard.org Install Raspbian on your Raspberry Pi Download NOOBS (New Out Of the Box Software) from the Raspberry Pi website (https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/). This is an easy operating system installation manager. Open the .zip you downloaded and select all files, then just drag and drop them onto your SD card. Insert the SD card in the Raspberry Pi then connect a monitor, keyboard and power cable. Connecting the power will cause the Raspberry Pi to boot up and the green and red LEDs on the board should light up. If the files are copied properly onto the SD card the green light will start flashing as the computer reads the data. After a few seconds you will see a window open on the monitor with a range of operating systems to install - use the arrow keys on the keyboard to choose Raspbian and hit ENTER to install. N.B. If you have trouble getting the NOOBS installation manager to work, you can also install Raspbian by copying the disk image of the operating system onto your micro SD card. Follow the instructions at https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/ to do this. Change the default password Before you go any further, make sure you change the default password, or anyone who knows the default will be able to access your home network. You can do this from the options screen you are shown the first time you boot up your Raspberry Pi after Raspbian is installed. When you next reboot your Raspberry Pi the login will be \"pi\" and the password whatever you have set. Give your Raspberry Pi a static IP address The IP address is what tells devices where to find your Raspberry Pi on your home network. Networks usually issue a dynamic IP address, which can change each time you power up the device. If you want to be able to consistently connect to your Raspberry Pi from outside your home network you need to fix its IP address so that it is always the same - a static IP address. Connect your Raspberry Pi to your router with an Ethernet cable. At command prompt type: ifconfig A bunch of information will come up and you need to note down what it says for your set against the following: inet addr [Current IP Address] bcast [Broadcast Range] mask [Subnet Mask] Next at the command prompt type: sudo route -n This tells you information about your router. Note down: Gateway Destination You now have all the information you need about your current IP set up and can edit the network configuration file to make the IP static. At command prompt type: sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces Look for the line that reads \"iface eth0 inet dhcp\" or \"iface eth0 inet manual\". The \"dhcp\" bit is requesting a dynamic IP or if your file says \"manual\" it is a manual setting, so use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the cursor so you can delete this and replace it with \"static\". Next put your cursor at the end of this line and hit Enter, then add the following lines directly below the line you just altered, filling the [square brackets] with the information you just noted down. address [your current IP address] netmask [your subnet mask] network [your destination] broadcast [your broadcast range] gateway [your gateway] To save the file press CTRL and X together, when prompted to save type \"y\" and hit Enter to accept the file name without changing it. At the command prompt type: sudo reboot Your Raspberry Pi will now restart with the new, static IP address. Set up an easy control system To save switching around cables if you do not have a spare HDMI monitor and keyboard you can download a free utility that lets you control your Raspberry Pi through a pop up window on another computer. This is called an SSH. The tool is called PuTTY (j.mp/DLPutty). Double click the PuTTY.exe file you download and it opens a dialogue box where you can enter the new static IP address you have given your Raspberry Pi. The first time you do this it will ask you to confirm accessing the device. You can now login and do everything you need to through this dialogue box on your computer, which means your Raspberry Pi never needs a monitor or keyboard to keep running. This is known as running it \"headless\". Update your Raspberry Pi One last piece of housekeeping to ensure you are running the latest software and drivers. At command prompt type: sudo apt-get update Wait for the updates to finish downloading and then type: sudo apt-get upgrade Wait until the upgrade completes. You are now ready to make your VPN The Raspbian operating system we just installed comes with OpenVPN ready to unpack, which is the software we will be using to make our VPN. At command prompt type: sudo apt-get install openvpn You will be asked to confirm your instruction then the software will be unpacked and installed. Generating keys Just like the unique key that unlocks your front door, your VPN needs keys generated to make sure that only authorised devices can connect to it. OpenVPN comes with Easy_RSA, a simple package for using the RSA encryption method to generate your unique keys. The next series of commands need to be done in the root directory. You will notice at the moment the command prompt sits in a directory labelled as 'pi@raspberrypi: ~ $'. Typing \"sudo\" before a command tells the operating system to execute the command in the root directory, but if you want to save yourself some typing you can go ahead and type: sudo -s You will now see your command prompt sits at 'root@raspberrypi:' Now, at the command type on one line: cp -r /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/easy-rsa/2.0 /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa Make sure you have spaces in the right places (before /usr and /etc). This instruction copies all of the files from the easy-rsa 2.0 directory into a directory in your openvpn installation. N.B. You can copy lines of text using right-click and then when you right click inside the PuTTY window it should paste, saving you a lot of typing. Be aware though, some formatting errors can occur when copying and pasting large blocks of text so if you do not get the result you are expecting, resort to typing the details in by hand. Next type: cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa This changes the directory your command prompt sits at to your openvpn/easy-rsa directory. You now need to edit the text in the file we just copied over. Nano is a simple text editor in Raspbian you are going to see a lot of over the next few pages. To open the file inside this text editor type: nano /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/vars In the text that opens find the line that begins: export EASY_RSA= You need to move the cursor down to edit this line to read: export EASY_RSA=\"/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa\" N.B. Make sure you remove any extraneous speech marks as anything other than the exact text above here will stop your keys from saving in the right place. Next move your cursor down until you see the line: export KEY_SIZE=1024 If you want to be extra secure you can change the value here to 2048 bit encryption, although the key you eventually build will take significantly longer to generate. If you choose to do this edit that line to read: export KEY_SIZE=2048 Keep scrolling to the end of the file and you will see a bunch of export parameters such as Country, Province and City etc. You can choose to change these to set new defaults (this will potentially save you some typing in various later stages), but doing so will not affect the workings of your VPN. Type CTRL and X then Y then ENTER to save this file. Build your certificates You are now set up to build the certificates your VPN will use to grant authority to devices you want to connect with. To open the easy-rsa directory, at the command prompt type: cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa Next type: source ./vars This loads the vars document you edited earlier. Next type: ./clean-all This will remove any previous keys in the system. Next type: ./build-ca This final line builds your certificate authority. The Raspberry Pi will now ask you to complete some additional export values, like Country, Province, City, Organisation etc. (if you changed these in the previous stage you will see your own choices already set as default). It is not necessary for these values to be accurate so just hit Enter each instance to use default value if you are feeling slack. Name the server Once you have entered through the fields and returned to the command prompt you need to name your server. Call it whatever you like but do not forget it. Type: ./build-key-server [ServerName] \u2026 replacing [ServerName] with your choice of name. You will now be given some more fields to enter values. You can change these or leave them as the defaults, but pay attention to three fields: Common Name MUST be the server name you picked. A challenge password? MUST be left blank. Sign the certificate? [y/n] Obviously, you must type \"y.\" Finally when prompted with the question: 1 out of 1 certificate requests certified, commit? [y/n] Type \"y\" Build keys for each user Your server is now set up and you need to build keys for all the devices you want to be able to connect. You can cut corners here and just build one key to use on all devices. Only one device can connect using each key at a time though, so if you want simultaneous connections you will need a different key for each one. To assign a user a key type: ./build-key-pass [UserName] \u2026 substituting the [UserName] with your desired text - for example to make a key to connect my android to the VPN I chose the name KateAndroid You will get some more prompts now: Enter PEM pass phrase \u2026 choose a password you will remember! It asks you to input this twice to eliminate errors. A challenge password? MUST be left blank. Sign the certificate? [y/n] Hit \"y\" Next type: cd keys then (using my example username, which you should change for your own): openssl rsa -in KateAndroid.key -des3 -out KateAndroid.3des.key This last line adds an extra layer of encryption to make it harder for hackers to break in. You will be asked to enter pass phrase for KateAndroid.key - this is the phrase you entered in the previous step. You will then be asked to enter and repeat a new PEM pass phrase for the des3 key. I used the same pass phrase for both so you only have one to remember. You will need the 3des.key pass phrase at the end of this process when you import your files to your devices. Repeat these steps for all the usernames you want to build a key for. You have now created your \"client certificates\". Type: cd .. Generate the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This is the code that lets two entities with no prior knowledge of one another share secret keys over a public server. Type: ./build-dh The screen will slowly fill with dots as the key is built from random numbers. It will take at least an hour if you upped your encryption to 2048-bit. If you left it at 1024-bit it could take as little as five minutes. Denial of Service (DoS) attack protection OpenVPN protects against this kind of attack by generating a static pre-shared hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) key. This means the server will not try to authenticate an access request if it does not detect this key. To generate the static HMAC key type: openvpn --genkey --secret keys/ta.key N.B. If you are using copy and paste it probably will not work on this line as the double \"-\" seems not to translate in the same way if you do not type it in. Configuring your server Now you have created all the locks and keys you need to tell your Raspberry Pi where you want to put the doors and who you want to give the keys to - essentially instructing the OpenVPN which keys to use, where you are going to be connecting from and which IP address and port to use. To do this you must create a server configuration file. At command prompt type: nano /etc/openvpn/server.conf This opens an empty file. Fill it with this text, taking care to change the details where indicated with a comment in # CAPS LOCK. (Placing a \"#\" in front of a sentence in the code like this tells the system it is a comment and to ignore it when building the program).  Also when changing the YOUR SERVER NAME sections I refer to the server name that was given to the 'build-key-server' command earlier on. local 192.168.2.0 # SWAP THIS NUMBER WITH YOUR RASPBERRY PI IP ADDRESS dev tun proto udp port 1194 ca /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/ca.crt cert /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/XX.crt # SWAP XX WITH YOUR SERVER NAME key /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/XX.key # SWAP XX WITH YOUR SERVER NAME dh /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/dh1024.pem # IF YOU CHANGED YOUR ENCRYPTION TO 2048, CHANGE THAT HERE server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0 # server and remote endpoints ifconfig 10.8.0.1 10.8.0.2 # Add route to Client routing table for the OpenVPN Server push \"route 10.8.0.1 255.255.255.255\" # Add route to Client routing table for the OpenVPN Subnet push \"route 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0\" # your local subnet push \"route 192.168.0.10 255.255.255.0\" # SWAP THE IP NUMBER WITH YOUR RASPBERRY PI IP ADDRESS # Set primary domain name server address to the SOHO Router # If your router does not do DNS, you can use Google DNS 8.8.8.8 push \"dhcp-option DNS 192.168.0.1\" # THIS SHOULD ALREADY MATCH YOUR OWN ROUTER ADDRESS AND SHOULD NOT NEED TO BE CHANGED # Override the Client default gateway by using 0.0.0.0/1 and # 128.0.0.0/1 rather than 0.0.0.0/0.

There is one last edit to make in the server configuration files to make sure your Raspberry Pi knows you want it to forward Internet traffic through our new network. Type: nano /etc/sysctl.conf Near the top it says, \"Uncomment the next line to enable packet forwarding for IPv4.\" You want to remove the \"#\" from the start of the next line to inform OpenVPN you want it to take that text into consideration. The line should then read: net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 Hit CTRL and X, then Y and ENTER to save. Finally you need to action the change you just made in the sysctl.conf file. To do this type: sysctl -p You have now made a functioning server that can access the internet. Pass through the firewall Raspbian has a built-in firewall that will block incoming connections, so we need to tell it to allow traffic from OpenVPN to pass through. To create a file that will run each time you start up your Raspberry Pi issuing this permission type: nano /etc/firewall-openvpn-rules.sh Inside this new file type: #!/bin/sh iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j SNAT --to-source 192.168.0.10 # SWAP THE IP NUMBER WITH YOUR RASPBERRY PI IP ADDRESS CTRL and X then Y and ENTER to save. Newly created files are not executable by default, so we will need to change the permissions and ownership of this file you just created. To do this type: chmod 700 /etc/firewall-openvpn-rules.sh then: chown root /etc/firewall-openvpn-rules.sh This script gives OpenVPN permission to breach the firewall and we now need to add it into the interfaces setup code so it runs on boot. Type: nano /etc/network/interfaces Find the line that says: \"iface eth0 inet static.\" We want to add a line below the list of numbers that follow it. This line needs to be added at an indent so hit TAB first: pre-up /etc/firewall-openvpn-rules.sh CTRL and X then Y and ENTER to save. Finally, reboot your Raspberry Pi by typing: Reboot N.B. Each time you reboot your Raspberry Pi you will need to relaunch PuTTY to connect to it. Ensure you have a static public IP address We have created locks and keys for devices to use to connect to your VPN, but before we hand those keys out we need to tell them where to find the front door. This is your public IP address, which should be kept a secret as it identifies your location on the internet. You can find out your public IP by asking Google. Just type \"what's my IP address?\" into the search box. If this address changes each time you log on you do not have a static IP address so will need to use a dynamic domain name system (DDNS) service to give yourself a domain name to put in place of the IP address. There is a free service at https://www.changeip.com Then on your Raspberry Pi, you need to run something called DDclient to update your DDNS registry automatically. At the command prompt type: sudo apt-get install ddclient This will launch a wizard for configuring ddclient. Don't worry too much about what you enter here as we will be entering the config file straight away. To edit the DDClient configuration with the correct setting type: sudo nano /etc/ddclient.conf Every service will have slightly different configuration, - if you are using changeip.com this blog post will tell you how to edit your settings successfully https://blogdotmegajasondotcom.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/use-ddclient-with-changeip-com/ CTRL and X then Y and ENTER to save. Finally, to set this program running type: sudo ddclient N.B. If you reboot your Raspberry Pi you'll need to type \"sudo ddclient\" to start running it again. Create profile scripts for the devices you want to connect We have created keys for clients (computers and devices) to use to connect to your VPN, but we have not told the clients where to find the server, how to connect, or which key to use. If you created several different client keys for each of the devices you want to grant access, it would be a lot of trouble to generate a new configuration file for each client from scratch. Luckily Eric Jodoin of the SANS institute has written a script to generate them automatically. First type: sudo nano /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/Default.txt Fill in the blank text file with the following: client dev tun proto udp remote [YOUR PUBLIC IP ADDRESS] 1194  #REPLACE YOUR DYNAMIC DNS VALUE FROM CHANGEIP.COM resolv-retry infinite nobind persist-key persist-tun mute-replay-warnings ns-cert-type server key-direction 1 cipher AES-128-CBC comp-lzo verb 1 mute 20 CTRL and X then Y and ENTER to save. Next, to create the script that makes your profile keys type: nano /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/MakeOVPN.sh In this file you need to add the text that Jodoin wrote to create the script: #!/bin/bash # Default Variable Declarations DEFAULT=\"Default.txt\" FILEEXT=\".ovpn\" CRT=\".crt\" KEY=\".3des.key\" CA=\"ca.crt\" TA=\"ta.key\" #Ask for a Client name echo \"Please enter an existing Client Name:\" read NAME #1st Verify that client's Public Key Exists if [ ! -f $NAME$CRT ]; then echo \"[ERROR]: Client Public Key Certificate not found: $NAME$CRT\" exit fi echo \"Client's cert found: $NAME$CR\" #Then, verify that there is a private key for that client if [ ! -f $NAME$KEY ]; then echo \"[ERROR]: Client 3des Private Key not found: $NAME$KEY\" exit fi echo \"Client's Private Key found: $NAME$KEY\" #Confirm the CA public key exists if [ ! -f $CA ]; then echo \"[ERROR]: CA Public Key not found: $CA\" exit fi echo \"CA public Key found: $CA\" #Confirm the tls-auth ta key file exists if [ ! -f $TA ]; then echo \"[ERROR]: tls-auth Key not found: $TA\" exit fi echo \"tls-auth Private Key found: $TA\" #Ready to make a new .opvn file - Start by populating with the default file cat $DEFAULT > $NAME$FILEEXT #Now, append the CA Public Cert echo \"<ca>\" >> $NAME$FILEEXT cat $CA >> $NAME$FILEEXT echo \"</ca>\" >> $NAME$FILEEXT #Next append the client Public Cert echo \"<cert>\" >> $NAME$FILEEXT cat $NAME$CRT | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' >> $NAME$FILEEXT echo \"</cert>\" >> $NAME$FILEEXT #Then, append the client Private Key echo \"<key>\" >> $NAME$FILEEXT cat $NAME$KEY >> $NAME$FILEEXT echo \"</key>\" >> $NAME$FILEEXT #Finally, append the TA Private Key echo \"<tls-auth>\" >> $NAME$FILEEXT cat $TA >> $NAME$FILEEXT echo \"</tls-auth>\" >> $NAME$FILEEXT echo \"Done! $NAME$FILEEXT Successfully Created.\" #Script written by Eric Jodoin \\ No newline at end of file CTRL and X then Y and ENTER to save. N.B. I was not able to successfully copy and paste the entire script accurately in one go, but taking it one section at a time worked no problem). Next you need to give this script permission to run. Type: cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/ The to give it root privileges type: chmod 700 MakeOVPN.sh Finally, execute the script with: ./MakeOVPN.sh As it runs, it will ask you to input the usernames names of the clients for you generated keys for earlier (in my case KateAndroid). Type that when prompted and you should see the line: Done! KateAndroid.ovpn Successfully Created. Repeat this step for each additional username you added client. Export your client keys for use on the connecting devices You now need to copy those keys onto the devices you want to use them. If you are using PuTTY on a Windows machine you can use a software package called WinSCP to do this. For Mac, try Fugu. First, to grant yourself read/write access to the folder at the command prompt type: chmod 777 /etc/openvpn chmod 777 /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa chmod 777 /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys chmod 777 /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/[ClientName].ovpn Be sure to undo this when you're done copying files by typing: chmod 600 /etc/openvpn and repeating for each step with the chmod 600 command, which removes read/write access again. You can now launch the software you are using to copy the files off your Raspberry Pi to navigate to the openvpn folder and copy the files labelled \"KateAndroid.ovpn\" etc. You can also open the command prompt on the machine in your network you would like to copy the files to and type: scp pi@[ip-address-of-your-pi]:/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/[ClientName].ovpn [ClientName].ovpn Install the OpenVPN Connect app on your device You are now ready to download and install the OpenVPN Connect app on your Android or iPhone - they are available through the stores as a free download. You will need to import the profile keys you just made as the final piece of the VPN connection puzzle. When prompted for a pass phrase here it is the 3des.key one you will need to enter. For iOS Use iTunes to add the .ovpn file to the OpenVPN Connect app. When you launch the app on your phone you will now get the option of installing that profile and making the connection. For Android Connect your android device to your computer with a USB cable. Navigate to the Downloads folder on your handset and paste the .ovpn file there. When you launch the app on your handset you can now tap the menu dropdown in the top right corner, select Import>Import profile from SD card then navigate to the downloads folder and choose to import the file and make the connection. One more thing After all this is done, if your phone still can't connect to the OpenVPN server you might need to adjust the firewall on your router to do port-forwarding of port 1194 to the Raspberry Pi. You'll need to follow the instructions from your ISP to access the router and complete this step. THANKS TO : https://twitter.com/zoodor for debugging this guide.",

The expense met with anger in Israel, which is facing austerity measures. Mr Netanyahu's office said the prime minister had been unaware of the cost. Israeli media reports said the cost was incurred by having four walls and door installed around a double bed, and 22 business class seats fitted on a plane chartered from El Al, Israel's national airline. The flight from Israel to the UK takes about five-and-a-half hours. The aircraft cost about $300,000 to use, before the custom fittings. Israel's Channel 10 first reported the story, which triggered angry reactions in the media. \"Bibi is king, and in a monarchy, when the king and queen fly, price is no object,\" said political commentator Sima Kadmon, referring to Mr Netanyahu by his nickname, in Israel's biggest-selling newspaper Yediot Ahranot. Mr Netanyahu's office said the prime minister needed a good night's sleep on the flight ahead of a day of busy schedules. It later said the prime minister had not been aware of the additional cost and had ordered cut-backs. Reports said customised \"rest chambers\" would no longer be used on European flights, while other media quoted his office as saying they would be dropped all together. The news came at a time when Israelis face tax rises as part of austerity measures being discussed by the cabinet. It also follows the revelation earlier this year that the prime minister's office had an annual budget of $2,700 for ice-cream bought by his staff from a Jerusalem shop.

			"Input": "summarize: The hosts claimed Australia's last five wickets for 44 runs on Friday morning to bowl them out for 308 and secure a first-innings lead of 122. Ian Bell and Joe Root both scored 60 and Ben Stokes 42 as England surged further ahead in the afternoon session to the delight of a buoyant Cardiff crowd. And although wickets fell regularly in a frenetic finale, Mark Wood's unbeaten 32 helped England reach 289 all out to set Australia an improbable 412 to win. Only two teams in Test history have successfully chased that many runs, with Australia's best effort the 404-3 by Don Bradman's 'Invincibles' at Headingley in 1948. England set the tone for a near-perfect day with an electric performance on the third morning, executing their plans to perfection to finish off the Australia innings. Shane Watson's vulnerability to lbws was brilliantly exploited as Stuart Broad dismissed him for 30 in the second over of the day before Wood pinned Nathan Lyon in front of his stumps. James Anderson found swing with the new ball to induce edges from Brad Haddin and Mitchell Starc, with Broad removing Mitchell Johnson in between. In little more than an hour, England had advanced from a position of relative strength to one of total control. After a nervy start with the bat - failures for Alastair Cook and Gary Ballance left England teetering on 22-2 - their second innings found momentum. Adam Lyth showed his mettle with a fluent 37, but the main catalyst was Bell, who put a dreadful sequence of 56 runs in nine innings behind him with a fine half-century. The Warwickshire batsman went on the front foot from the off, lashing two cover drives in one Mitchell Starc over and peppering the third-man boundary with his trademark late cut. He reached fifty off 75 balls, and underlined his new-found confidence by crashing Johnson over cover for his 11th four. The next ball brought Bell's undoing however, as, clearly expecting the short ball, he backed away slightly and was clean bowled to give Johnson his first wicket of the match. By the time of Bell's dismissal, England were flying and the in-form duo of Root and Stokes kept them airborne, with both finding the boundary nine times. A mini-collapse from 207-4 to 245-8 in the last session gave Australia a glimmer of hope, only for England to find inspiration from an unlikely source. Swinging from the hip, Wood took the lead role in a 43-run partnership for the ninth wicket with Moeen Ali and was still at the crease when Anderson became Lyon's fourth victim in the very last action of the day. England's brilliance has set up the possibility of a four-day finish, and the hosts would be wise to do their utmost to wrap things up on Saturday because of heavy showers forecast for Sunday. Australia will no doubt still fancy their chances of pulling off a record-breaking victory, but in reality the Welsh weather represents their best chance of avoiding going into next week's second Test at Lord's 1-0 down. Australia spinner Nathan Lyon: \"We're definitely still in it. If we bat two days the result will go our way. There's no reason why we can't dig deep. \"We've got to learn from our first innings with the bat - be more patient. There were too many 30s in the first innings, so we need to try and push on a bit more and have a couple of our top five get big hundreds.\" England batsman Ian Bell: \"There are no gimmes and we expect more tomorrow. We are going to have to work hard to win.\"",

There were errors, of course, and her movement is a work in progress, but she served strongly and returned with aggressive intent: hitting nearly twice as many winners as unforced errors. And she played with sheer bloody mindedness, in the way she always has. The Stuttgart crowd was respectful of Sharapova, and generous in her moment of victory, although the real warmth was reserved for her opponent. This first win will move the former world number one to the cusp of the top 500, but her ambitions for the week will stretch further, given the way she played and the frailties of some of the top seeds. Defeats for both Agnieszka Radwanska and Garbine Muguruza mean Sharapova cannot face a seeded player before the semi-finals. The top players in the women's game remain maddeningly inconsistent, and with Serena Williams pregnant, Victoria Azarenka on maternity leave and Petra Kvitova still recuperating from December's stabbing, there are opportunities galore. Sharapova is a five-time Grand Slam champion, and a likely future champion. This may be her 15th year on tour, but she has missed more time than most due to shoulder problems, as well as the ban. And rest did Roger Federer no harm before the Australian Open in Melbourne, when he clinched his 18th Grand Slam title after a six-month injury lay-off. She has won Slams on all surfaces and is brimming with motivation on her return from what she considers an unduly harsh ban imposed for an administrative error. And mentally, she is stronger than anyone bar Serena Williams. But it will probably take time. Stringing together seven wins in a row at a Grand Slam is notoriously difficult when you lack match practice and sharpness, and Sharapova may have to negotiate an extra three matches of qualifying at Roland Garros and Wimbledon. This was one of the main themes of her first news conference with regular tennis writers for 15 months. I thought she seemed nervous, quite frosty and was confrontational at times. \"I'm not getting a wildcard to receive a trophy or a golden platter,\" she said when asked about the numerous tournament invitations which have upset so many of her peers. \"I have to get through the matches and I still have to win them and that's my job.\" Caroline Wozniacki and Radwanska are just two players to have questioned why a player returning from a doping ban is being offered so many wildcards. The former world number one and number two were dismissed as \"journeyman\" players by Sharapova's agent Max Eisenbud. \"I don't control my manager's words,\" Sharapova said when asked for her response, and then made no attempt to distance herself in the slightest from the sentiments. \"I'm sure he's been watching everyone's comments in the previous 15 months and he's entitled to his own opinion.\" Sharapova's lack of camaraderie has never held her back in the past, and she still has no desire to form friendships on tour. That wouldn't help her tennis, she pointed out. The locker room is where you go for an ice bath, she argued. Her true friends can be found away from the workplace. Sharapova would love to be at Roland Garros and Wimbledon this year, and she says she would be \"prepared to play in the juniors\" if it helped. She would need to reach the final here in Stuttgart to earn sufficient ranking points to gain direct entry into the qualifying draw of the French Open. If she fails to do so, her fate will be revealed to great fanfare on the evening of Tuesday 16 May, when wildcards for both qualifying and the main draw will be announced on Facebook Live. The All England Club is unlikely to go down the same route. Officially, wildcard recipients will not be determined until Tuesday 20 June, by which time Sharapova could be back in the top 100 and eligible for the main Wimbledon draw. To do so she will need to earn close to 600 ranking points from this week and her next two tournaments in Madrid and Rome. A return of one semi-final and one quarter-final is likely to be enough, but that would still be some effort after so long away from the sport.",

Mr Di Natale said he was not suggesting a specific model, but workers would need to be guaranteed adequate income. Australia's two major parties have not commented on the proposal, but it has drawn criticism from an economist. In the dark days of the 19th Century, many workers in industrialised nations considered themselves lucky if they got Sunday off. The achievement of a 40-hour week with Saturday and Sunday off for many was a major landmark for the labour movement. But some have tried to go further. In 2008, about 17,000 government officials in the US state of Utah started working four 10-hour days in a bid to cut costs. The experiment didn't last: the five-day week was reinstated in 2011. Other US states have also toyed with the idea. The Gambia recently scrapped its four-day working week, which had been designed to allow people more flexibility on Fridays. But what is the ideal working week, and could the four-day week become more widespread? Read more: How shorter weeks have worked elsewhere Mr Di Natale said he wanted to start a national conversation on the future of work. \"It's time we recognised there are big questions we're not asking ourselves. What sort of society do we want to be?\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC). \"We have some many people in this country who are working more hours than they should.\" He said Australia could follow other countries in trialling a social security safety net to guarantee adequate income. Economist Saul Eslake said he did not support the proposal, comparing it to France's 35-hour working week. \"The French are good at many things, but economic management is not one of them,\" he told the ABC. \"Their economy has grown at barely more than 1% per annum over the past seven years.\"",

Its illustrious fans have included the Queen Mother, Margaret Thatcher and actors such as Cary Grant. But after the British firm was saved from administration in 2012, it has mainly focused on China and last year saw its UK sales fall 16%. Hong Kong-based YGM Trading, which bought it for \u00a315m four years ago, said Aquascutum is due to be sold in March 2017 to two buyers. The unnamed acquirers have made a $5m down payment for exclusive rights to the deal, YGM said in its annual report this week. Chinese textile firm Shandong Ruyi Group is understood to be one of the buyers, according to Bloomberg. Aquascutum started as a Mayfair tailors in 1851, rising to prominence after its founder, John Emary, patented the first waterproof textile. Its trench coats were worn by British soldiers during the First World War, while in 1953 its wyncol fabric - designed to withstand 100 mph winds - was used by explorer Edmund Hillary in the first confirmed ascent of Mount Everest. The coats were also a regular feature on the silver screen, with Sean Connery wearing one in Another Time, Another Place in 1958 and Sophia Loren in The Key. However, the retailer has struggled in recent years, closing its Nottinghamshire factory in 2012 and then falling into administration. Under YGM's ownership, the company's primary focus has been China, with 135 of its 146 outlets located in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.

Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the Conservatives were \"talking up\" the SNP's prospects. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon was in New Lanark, while Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy was on the campaign trail in Cumbernauld. Speaking at the Dawnfresh fish factory in Uddingston, Ms Davdison believed that a Labour government propped up by the SNP would be damaging for the UK's finances. She said that under a Conservative government minimum wage earners would pay no income tax. Ms Davidson added: \"We're the party which will sort out the economy so that we can afford a great NHS and give you and your family the chance to make the most of your lives. \"The SNP and Labour have the brass neck to pretend that they have a plan for the economy but any plan based on more taxes, more borrowing and more debt would wreck all the hard work of the last five years.\" However, Mr Rennie, who was campaigning in Pittenweem, said the Conservatives, were \"putting their party before their country by seeking to increase their vote share at any price\". He added: \"The Conservative election campaign has repeatedly talked up the SNP. Immediately after the UK leaders debates, George Osborne was talking up the performance of Nicola Sturgeon. \"I am not sure what kind of bizarre tactical game he was playing but it can only have helped the SNP increase their support further. \"And now the Conservatives in Scotland are getting in the way of our battles to stop the SNP in the 11 Westminster seats we hold in Scotland.\" What are the top issues for each political party at the 2015 general election?

She said: \"People in Scotland have always known to expect harsh, ideological cuts from the Tories - and today's cuts manifesto is likely to be more of the same. But that Labour have been so quick to meekly fall into line with George Osborne's plans just goes to show how far they have moved away from their roots. \"And with Ed Balls lifting the lid on Labour's cuts plans yesterday and finally putting an end to Jim Murphy's anti-cuts pretence, Labour's commitment to austerity is clear for all to see.\" The SNP leader and first minister of Scotland had earlier taken questions from listeners on BBC Radio's Five Live morning phone in. In response to a question from presenter Nicky Campbell, Ms Sturgeon reiterated that she was not planning another independence referendum. She said that if you voted SNP on 7 May, you were not voting for another referendum. In Cumbernauld, Mr Murphy said SNP plans for Scottish taxes supporting Scotland's finances would mean millions lost for working families in tax credits. Mr Murphy said: \"The SNP's reckless plans will cost working families the most, with a \u00a37.6bn black hole in Scotland's finances and the end of the UK welfare state as we know it. \"Scotland doesn't have to choose between Tory austerity or SNP austerity max. Scottish Labour is the only party on the ballot paper offering a real alternative to austerity. \"Only Labour is big enough and strong enough to kick the Tories out and give working families the support they need.\" Meanwhile, the Scottish Greens backed the manifesto commitments of the Green Party of England and Wales which they believe would make a positive difference to people's lives. Alison Johnstone, from the Scottish Greens said: \"Greens across these islands are clear: we must end Westminster's failed austerity experiment.\" Voters throughout the UK go to the polls on 7 May to choose their next MP.

Hank Green, a prominent video producer and entrepreneur, said YouTube gave musicians \"new revenue streams\". The row comes as the video-sharing website renews its agreements with major record labels. Prominent voices in the music industry have accused YouTube of paying low royalties for music video streams and turning a blind eye to copyright infringement. In March, the Recording Industry Association of America said YouTube paid \"meagre\" royalties when compared to subscription music services such as Apple Music and Spotify. On Monday, music manager Irving Azoff, formerly in charge of Ticketmaster and who now represents artists such as Christina Aguilera, said artists were paid a \"pittance\" on the advertising-funded site. In an open letter, he said YouTube did not allow musicians to put their tracks behind its YouTube Red pay-wall to earn more revenue. He also accused YouTube of \"hiding behind\" a so-called \"safe harbour\" provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which stops websites being held responsible for copyright infringement by users, in some circumstances. Trying to keep copyright music off YouTube was \"an impossible, expensive game of 'whack-a-mole',\" he said. \"When the artist sends a 'take down' it should be a 'stay down'.\" YouTube said comparing subscription services to free advertising-funded websites was \"like comparing what a cab driver earns from fares to what they earn showing ads in their taxi\". In a blog post, the company said it paid \"a majority\" - more than 50% - of its advertising income to content creators and the music industry. However, it added that the average YouTube user listened to only one hour of music a month, compared to the 55 hours a month it said Spotify subscribers consumed. The company said its Content ID technology could detect when copyright music was uploaded to the website and automatically dealt with 99.5% of copyright claims. It said record labels had the choice of whether to earn advertising revenue from unauthorised uploads or have them blocked indefinitely, and that half of the $3bn (\u00c2\u00a32bn) it had paid out to the music industry came from monetising these \"unauthorised uploads\" by the public. Income from its subscription service YouTube Red, available in the US, was shared with content creators and musicians in the same way as advertising revenue. YouTube has been separately criticised by video-makers who say Content ID does not respect the \"fair use\" of television and film extracts, which is protected by a provision of the DMCA. It has attempted to address the problem by allowing disputed videos to earn advertising revenue which is kept until the correct copyright holder can be identified. Hank Green, co-founder of the world's biggest online video convention VidCon, described YouTube's Content ID technology as a \"win-win\" situation for record labels. \"[Record labels] can take the video down, or they can claim the revenue for themselves... this is not an expensive game of 'whack-a-mole', it's 100% automated,\" he wrote in a reply to Mr Azoff. \"They've been given a new 10-figure revenue stream of claimed fan creations that they never would have had without YouTube.\" Singer Dave Giles, a regular performer at YouTube events, said musicians did benefit from advertising-supported streams on the video site. \"It was interesting that when Taylor Swift took her songs off Spotify, she kept them on YouTube,\" he told the BBC. \"If it wasn't really helping her career, surely she should have taken them off there as well. \"Spotify might be paying more per stream than YouTube, but they have more subscribers. There's an argument that YouTube should be doing more to push its subscription model, but they are still rolling it out. \"It's still more than artists get on Facebook. Where's Mr Azoff's email about that? Why is YouTube facing the rap and Facebook not?\"",

The books, in Sir Terry's birthplace of Limerick, will allow people to mark the passing of \"a true son of Limerick\", the city's mayor Liam Galvin said. Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: \"He was the absolute governor.\" A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London. In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners. At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: \"He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years. \"All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident. \"And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes. \"Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.\" Evans described Sir Terry as his \"radio dad\" and said that Radio 2 was \"in disbelief and shock\". \"He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,\" added Evans. \"He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.\" BBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry \"one of the greatest broadcasters of our age\". \"Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,\" he said. \"You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one. \"But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them.\" Prime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a \"wonderful human being\". \"I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour,\" he said. Veteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was \"stunned\" at the news and that his condolences were \"very much with Helen and the family\". Sir Terry died surrounded by his family \"after a short but brave battle with cancer\", a statement released by his family said. He leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy. An online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning. The city's mayor said: \"Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots. \"The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.\" President of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was \"always proud of his origins in Limerick\", and returned frequently to his native country. Family friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was \"shocked\" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had \"put it out that he had a bad back\". The Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin. \"I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money. \"For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,\" he added. Sir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon. Blessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance. He also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event. From 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan. The second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or \"Terry's Old Geezers and Gals\". Tributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday. BBC director general Lord Hall said: \"He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.\" Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was \"one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard\". Sir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career. Radio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a \"radio genius\", saying: \"The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.\" Sir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account. The singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: \"Such a special and funny man. \"A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter.\" Members of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity. Norman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: \"He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster. \"He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it.\" Sir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later. When he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: \"The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you. \"When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine.\" Sir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015. The One Show: A Tribute to Sir Terry will be broadcast at 19:00 GMT on Monday 1 February.",

With only one team guaranteed a place at Russia 2018, England top Group F after three games with Scotland fourth. Wayne Rooney returns to captain England with Scotland captain Darren Fletcher saying a draw would be a good result. The sides - who first met in 1872 - played friendlies in 2013 and 2014 but last played competitive matches in a two-legged play-off for Euro 2000 in November 1999. Scotland won at Wembley but England won 2-1 on aggregate. England Under-21 boss Gareth Southgate was put in charge of the senior team for four games following the departure of Sam Allardyce after only one match. Allardyce left following a newspaper investigation claiming he offered advice on how to \"get around\" rules on player transfers. Under Southgate, England beat Malta 2-0 and drew with Slovenia in World Cup qualifiers. After the match against Scotland, England meet Spain in a friendly at Wembley on 15 November. Asked if he wanted the job on a permanent basis, he said: \"I'm really enjoying being in the role. \"What happens to me is not important. We have to win this game for the country, and because we want to be top of the group and heading to [the 2018 World Cup] in Russia. \"What happens to me is important to my family, but other than that it isn't the purpose of the game. I want the players to enjoy the football and play well. \"My focus is 100% on the match and it would irresponsible and unprofessional for it to be any other way.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Scotland manager Gordon Strachan - who has faced scrutiny coming into the game - says he does not need to impress on his players the importance of the match. \"My players are intelligent enough to understand the fixture,\" Strachan said. \"I don't think I have to show them anything. \"They know the fixture, everybody knows the fixture. It's known throughout the world. So I don't have to show them the importance. \"The importance is not to become caught up in the emotion of the game. It's important to use your emotion and passion, to run further than you've ever run before, to jump higher than you've ever jumped, to concentrate more. \"I don't think you get too emotional. If you get too emotional then you can lose focus. So we're looking for that emotion and passion to play better than we've ever played before.\" Media playback is not supported on this device The match at Wembley is a 90,000 sell-out, which is expected to include at least 14,000 Scotland fans. \"It doesn't get much bigger than this - there will be a little more fire in the belly, it being England v Scotland,\" Scotland captain Darren Fletcher said. \"Every time you lead your country out it is important but there is no bigger stage than Wembley in front of 90,000 fans.\" England midfielder Jordan Henderson, who captained the team against Slovenia, said: \"It is a massive game. If you look at the history of the fixture, it's not a normal game. \"We watched a video of a lot of the past games. There was a few I can remember, especially Paul Gascoigne's goal at Euro 96. \"The lads know the importance of the game, not only because it's England v Scotland but also because we want to qualify for the World Cup.\" Henderson also addressed criticism that England are a team lacking in leadership. The Liverpool captain told BBC Radio 5 live: \"Everyone's entitled to their opinion - I've learned that over the years - but it doesn't really matter what other people think, it only matters what the team thinks and what the manager and the management team think. \"They are the only important opinions that matter to us. I know there are leaders in the team, I know we've got great characters so that isn't a question in our dressing room. \"The question is can we got out there and perform at the highest level to win the game. I'm confident we can.\" Media playback is not supported on this device New tennis world number one Andy Murray is expected to be among the huge Scotland support at Wembley, with Fletcher confident his side can be inspired by Murray's rise through the ranks. Murray became the first British singles player to be world number one since computerised rankings began in 1973 last week. \"For us, he is an inspiration for what he has achieved in tennis,\" said Fletcher. \"His never-say-die attitude, looking to keep improving and battling for a number of years against arguably some of the greatest tennis players of all time and to keep driving himself forward to try to improve those small margins. \"He has fought to be the number one tennis player in the world so we can take inspiration from him as a sportsman, showing that there is no real ceiling on what you can achieve if you dedicate yourself. \"If you have real dedication and desire, you can achieve almost what you wish.\" The Football Associations of England and Scotland have said they will let players wear black armbands with poppy emblems as the game takes place on Armistice Day. Fifa believes that could breach football's rules on displaying \"political, religious or personal slogans, statements or images\" and has warned the countries could face sanctions as a result. Both FAs said they are willing to face any punishment - though they insist it will not come to that. Media playback is not supported on this device \"We're just pleased everything was resolved last week, that we can honour the sacrifice of those who have gone before us,\" said Southgate. \"It's part of our identity as a nation.\" Henderson added: \"The poppy is very important for the country and the players to remember what those people did for this country, the sacrifice.\" It's not meant to be easy!

			"Input": "summarize: From a team that lays claim to being the first World Cup winner to a side featuring Chris Waddle's son, the qualifying rounds are full of interesting stories. The long journey to the FA Cup final begins on Friday, with 368 teams competing in the extra preliminary round. BBC Sport takes a look at some of the more intriguing stories surrounding those qualifying games. With a long history and a famous tradition, the FA Cup is widely regarded as the most prestigious domestic cup competition in the world. West Auckland Town have reached the first round proper of the competition on three previous occasions, but supporters speak most fondly about their biggest claim to fame - being the first winners of the World Cup. The team from the small County Durham village were invited to participate in the inaugural Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy in 1909. It was one of the first international tournaments in world football and, consequently, was considered by some as the first World Cup. West Auckland Town won the tournament, and repeated that feat two years later, beating Juventus 6-1. \"There was nothing about it in the English press at the time, but it was massive news in Italy and all over the newspapers,\" says the club's general manager Stuart Alderson. \"We got to keep the trophy and we had it on display until 1994, when it was stolen. We have a replica now, and people still come from all over the world to see it.\" West Auckland begin their pursuit of FA Cup glory at Lancashire-based side Nelson, a team which also boasts a proud history, having been the first English side to beat Real Madrid in Spain. They were a league side during the 1920s, rising to the old Second Division - now the Championship - in 1923, beating the likes of Leeds and Manchester United. In preparation for their first campaign at that level, they opted for a pre-season tour of Spain, where they beat Real Oviedo 2-1 and Real Madrid 4-2. \"Everybody is well aware of the team's history in Nelson,\" manager Mark Fell said. \"The story of beating Real Madrid has been passed from generation to generation. \"This club has a rich history and it is our job to make this generation proud of their team.\" When the teams are read out for Staveley Miners Welfare's tie against Worksop Town on Friday night, there could be a very familiar name among them. Jack Waddle, the 20-year-old son of former England winger Chris, recently signed for Worksop, the side his father played for 15 years ago. \"Jack is very much following in his father's footsteps,\" Worksop secretary Paul Stacey said. \"He missed our first two games through injury, however I believe he is in the squad for the FA Cup game.\" Chris Waddle played in two FA Cup finals at Wembley - losing one with Spurs in 1987 and another with Sheffield Wednesday in 1993. With a World Cup winner and the son of an England winger involved, there is already an international feel to the FA Cup, but that is heightened by the inclusion of FC Romania. It is not the country, of course, but a team named after it. Formed by Romanian Ion Vintila and his friends eight years ago, Hertfordshire-based FC Romania have progressed a great deal since playing their first competitive fixture against a team called Beating Chastards. They shot up seven leagues in eight seasons, turned semi-professional this year and have even had a former international footballer on their books. Claudiu Raducanu, capped twice by Romania, previously played for Espanyol in Spain and Romanian side Steaua Bucharest, for whom he scored against Southampton in the 2004-05 Uefa Cup. He left in the summer but Vintila has not ruled out the possibility of him returning. The prospect of an FA Cup appearance may prove a tempting proposition. \"The FA Cup is the oldest competition in football, and it was always our goal to play in it,\" says Vintila. \"We usually get around 80 to 100 people at games, but hopefully 500 will come down for this game.\" FC Romania, making their FA Cup debut, play Haverhill Rovers in the extra preliminary round this weekend. As a child, James Phillips used to dream of guiding a non-league side to FA Cup glory as he played Championship Manager on his computer. On Saturday, the 22-year-old Romsey Town boss will not only get to live out his dream, but he'll also be making history as the youngest manager in the competition's history. \"I was one of those sad people after school who was sat there for hours playing Championship Manager,\" Phillips told BBC Sport. \"I always used to try to take a really small club up through the leagues. From a really young age that got my interest going. Now I'm doing it in real life.\" Perhaps winning the award for the most unusual name, and statistic, is Billingham Synthonia - the only team in England named after an agricultural fertiliser. The Synners most famous player is Brian Clough. The former Derby County and Nottingham Forest manager made four appearances for them, scoring three goals in the 1952-53 season before he went on national service. On Saturday, the team named after fertiliser host Durham City. It could make for an interesting tie if they progress and are drawn against West Allotment Celtic in the preliminary round... Never mind dreaming of a Wembley final appearance, the players at one club have their eye on another prize for doing well in the FA Cup - \u00a315 kit bags. Sporting Khalsa host Pegasus Juniors and, if they win to progress to the preliminary round, a bag sporting the club's emblem is all theirs. \"That's the joys of the FA Cup at grassroots level,\" Sporting Khalsa manager Ian Rowe told the FA. \"The pros are fortunate enough to get to the quarter finals, semi-final and final - we are just looking to win one game so I can splash the cash and buy the lads a \u00a315 bag each.\" Ellesmere Rangers have been involved in the FA Cup every year since 2008-09, but they got into this season's edition by the skin of their teeth. The Shropshire-based team compete in the West Midlands League Premier Division - the 10th level of English football -  and qualified under the FA's points per game system, which rewards those clubs who miss out on automatic qualification with a place in the competition based on their form across the previous season. Ellesmere qualified in the final slot, effectively making them entry number 736 - the last team in the hat. \"We finished 11th last season so we didn't expect to get in this year,\" says club secretary John Edge. \"It really is a big boost for the club because the prize money can help you through a whole season.\" On 30 May, 2015, the FA Cup trophy will stand on a pedestal at a packed Wembley, but its journey begins in more humble surroundings. The trophy will travel to Gloucestershire on Saturday, to the town of Fairford, whose team begin their FA Cup journey with a home tie against Knaphill. \"It is a huge day for the club,\" said committee member Chris Tanner. \"Everyone at Fairford is looking forward to the game and to have the FA Cup coming to town is quite special. \"The FA Cup generates tremendous interest for clubs both in the professional game and non-league and Saturday will be no different. \"Perhaps some won't have realised the FA Cup starts in August.\" The Football Association has quite a job on its hands to make sure all extra preliminary round results are accurate, and that teams do not field ineligible players. In previous years, the home club would report results by voicemail message, which would then have to be decoded by the FA and Press Association before the result could be confirmed and later published. These days the system is set up to be more efficient. The FA sends out an automated text message to each club 15 minutes after kick-off, which explains how the result needs to be reported by text simply by replying to the message. The result and attendance is then published automatically on receipt by The FA of the incoming text message. In order to avoid clubs fielding ineligible players, both teams are required to complete an official team sheet, which is then inspected by a match official, prior to a tie taking place. The above are just a few of the unique tales to come from this year's FA Cup, but we want to hear your FA Cup story. Do you have an interesting tale to tell about your team's exploits and do you have any pictures that best sum up the magic of the cup?

Motor neurone disease (MND) campaigner Gordon Aikman is awarded the British Empire Medal. John Muir, who has campaigned against knife crime following the murder of his son, receives an MBE. And Edinburgh-born broadcaster Nicky Campbell has been given an OBE for services to children. Campbell, a regular on TV and radio for years, has spoken openly about his experience of being adopted and is a patron of the British Association for Adoption and Fostering (BAAF). Dr MacMillan, who wrote a new choral piece which was sung when Pope Benedict XVI conducted mass at Bellahouston Park in Glasgow in 2010, is being knighted for services to music. His compositions are widely played around the world by performers ranging from top international orchestras to local church and community choirs. Dr MacMillan said: \"I am totally delighted to receive this honour. I am especially pleased that the world of music, and contemporary composition in particular, will receive greater focus and recognition as a result.\" The 55-year-old composer, who was born in Kilwinning in North Ayrshire, has previously described the high point of his career as \"writing a piece for the unveiling of a statue of the founder of Celtic FC\". Mr Aikman, 30, from Edinburgh, is being awarded the British Empire Medal after raising \u00c2\u00a3300,000 to raise awareness of MND, which he was diagnosed with last year. The former Scottish Labour spindoctor, who set up his GordonsFightback.com campaign after being diagnosed, said: \"Day in, day out thousands of people across this country are bravely battling this disease. \"I want to share this honour with each and every one of my fellow fighters.\" Aileen Paterson, the creator of Maisie the kitten, is also among those to receive an honour. The author, who penned the much-loved series of books about adventures of a cat from Edinburgh's Morningside, is being awarded with an MBE for services to children's literature. The same honour has been awarded to campaigner John Muir, who led demands for tougher sentences for knife crime after his son Damian was stabbed to death in the centre of Greenock in 2007. From the sporting world, Peter Dawson, the chief executive of The R&A and secretary of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, is recognised with an OBE. Mr Dawson will step down in September after 16 years leading the body which organises the Open Championship. Iain McMillan, who was the director of the CBI in Scotland for almost two decades, is to be knighted for his services to the economy north of the border. The same honour goes to Prof Pete Downes, who has been the principal and vice-chancellor of Dundee University since 2009, in recognition of his work in higher education and life sciences. Prof Downes is one of the UK's most distinguished and cited bioscientists, and identified the role of the drug Lithium in treating manic depression. Dr Lena Wilson, the chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, the national economic development agency, is recognised for her efforts with a CBE. As part of her role, she has travelled to more than 60 countries across the world, promoting Scottish business interests and advising governments on foreign investment and private sector development. Lynne McNicoll, who has raised more than \u00c2\u00a31m to support children with cancer and their families, will be presented with an OBE. Her fundraising activities inspired her to set up the Edinburgh-based charity It's Good 2 Give five years ago, and she has continued to raise funds despite being diagnosed with breast cancer earlier this year. The charity is currently raising funds to build a special centre where youngsters with cancer and their families can go for breaks of up to seven days. She said: \"I am astonished to receive this sort of recognition, it's a tremendous honour. I lead a unique team of volunteers, including our trustees, who have supported so many families through their cancer ordeal.\"",

In reply, captain Hashim Amla (23 not out) took 46 balls to score a run, as South Africa made 72 in as many overs. A 300-plus target has been reached just once on Indian soil, when the home team struck 387-4 to defeat England in 2008. India resumed 403 runs ahead on 190-4 but skipper Virat Kohli added only five runs to his overnight 83 before a low Kyle Abbott delivery trapped him leg before to end the only century partnership of the series at 154. Rahane, the only centurion of the series, was not to be denied another hundred, however. The 27-year-old slog-swept Imran Tahir over mid-wicket for his second six of the innings and flicked Dean Elgar for another to move into the 90s. He joined Vijay Hazare, Sunil Gavaskar (three times), Rahul Dravid (twice) and Kohli as the only India batsman to reach three figures twice in the same Test match. South Africa blocked resolutely after left-hander Elgar was caught at slip in the fifth over, with India spinner Ravi Jadeja conceding only 10 runs from his 23 overs. The usually destructive AB de Villiers maintained the team tactic, using 33 balls to score his first run. His partnership with the captain did not produce a single run in the first 10 overs, but both batsmen survived to retain their team's hopes of avoiding defeat.

That is about half the list price of the existing product, which is used in emergencies for severe food and insect allergies. The cost of EpiPens in the US has risen by 500% in less than a decade. Mylan said the generic version would be identical to the branded EpiPen, which costs $600 for two doses. Allergy sufferers often have several pens - one to keep at home, as well as others at school or work, or in the car. They also expire after 12 months. Mylan chief executive Heather Bresch said the company had spent hundreds of millions of dollars improving the product since buying the product from Merck in 2007. \"Our decision to launch a generic alternative to EpiPen is an extraordinary commercial response,\" she said. \"We determined that bypassing the brand system in this case and offering an additional alternative was the best option.\" The move is unusual because the branded version is still under patent and other rival treatments have failed to get regulatory clearance. The product generates annual sales of $1bn for Mylan. Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said: \"We suspect Mylan will continue to receive some heat for its price increases and there will be heightened pressure on FDA [regulator the Food and Drug Administration] to bring competition to the market.\" Ms Bresch also blamed the complex US health care system for the price rises and said that Mylan took just $274 of the $600 list price, while insurers, pharmacies and other parties shared the rest. How much individuals pay for an EpiPen prescription can depend on their insurance coverage. Politicians and parents have challenged the price hikes, with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton calling them \"outrageous\" and unjustified. The outcry over EpiPen price rises sent Mylan shares falling about 12% last week. The stock was flat at $43.04 in afternoon trading in New York. Actor Sarah Jessica Parker, who had endorsed EpiPens, said last week she was ending her relationship with Mylan.

PIPs started replacing disability allowance in April 2013. Labour, along with several charities, criticised the government for the way it handled the switchover, which left about 3,000 people waiting more than a year to have their welfare claims processed. The High Court is now conducting a judicial review into the payment system. The claimants said they struggled to pay for food and fuel because of the delays and their health declined as a result.

The lagoon, which generates a man-made wave using new technology, suffered its third fault last week since it opened at the end of July. Bosses have apologised to customers. The lagoon was filled with more than six million gallons (33,000 cubic metres) of filtered rainwater for its opening but a fault led to it being emptied in August. It was also shut for five days earlier in September due to a tear in the lagoon liner. The latest fault is due to a \"serious failure\" of the main drive mechanism of the wave generating machinery which could take three months to repair. Martin Ainscough, chairman of the Ainscough Group which owns Surf Snowdonia, said:  \"This is a very disappointing day for us all at Surf Snowdonia, and we know it's especially difficult for our excellent staff and for all of the people who have booked to come surfing with us. \"During the winter closure period we will be making further investment in order to improve the surf lagoon and broaden our offer. \"Surf Snowdonia was always intended as a long term investment in our group and our extra investment over the winter will prove our absolute commitment to make Surf Snowdonia a success.\" The attraction received \u00c2\u00a34m of Welsh government funding in 2014.

Peers serving in the UK cabinet have set the precedent, he added. Parties in the assembly have questioned the idea on the grounds of democracy and accountability. The accountants' organisation said scrutiny of Welsh legislation was suffering due to \"significant workloads for politicians shifting from Westminster to Cardiff Bay\". If it proved difficult to increase the number of AMs from the present 60, a bigger role could be given to the 40 MPs from Wales as their role in Parliament diminished, Mr Warren said. He suggested letting the first minister appoint MPs to the Welsh cabinet, or inviting MPs to serve on assembly committees, in both cases reducing the demands on the time of politicians in Cardiff Bay. Another idea put forward was the creation of a non-political body of professionals who could advise on and scrutinise policy. \"Wales is a small country with limited resources and making best use of those resources within a democratic framework to achieve for Wales must surely be an objective that crosses all political borders,\" said Mr Warren. Dr Rebecca Rumbul, politics lecturer at the Centre for Lifelong Learning at Cardiff University, said involving MPs in assembly business might be \"confusing\" to voters. Liberal Democrat AM Peter Black was also doubtful, claiming MPs \"won't be able to do either job properly\".

But there's no protection from a barking dog - or its owner. At one doorstep the householder told the DUP candidate not to worry,  his animal didn't bite, before adding rather worryingly \"unless I tell him to\". The pet owner then tackled Gavin Robinson about the pact agreed between the DUP and the Ulster Unionists in East Belfast, telling him \"I didn't like you joining up with two parties together against Naomi\". The candidate responded that the deal had been decided \"over my head\". On another doorstep not far away another candidate, Alliance's Naomi Long came across another over excited dog, named Chuckie. \"Don't worry\" the lady who answered the door assured her, \"Chuckie's an Alliance supporter\". Naomi Long's victory over the DUP leader Peter Robinson, who held East Belfast for 30 years, was the big surprise of the 2010 election. Alliance benefited from an anti-Robinson mood after TV investigations into his family's business dealings and a decision by some loyalists to lend their votes to Ms Long. But since then the Alliance MP has found herself on the receiving end of death threats as a result of the Belfast council Union Flag dispute. She told me the intimidation remains a regular occurrence - indeed she was hit by a projectile just this week after visiting a nail salon which had been targeted by racist arsonists. Whilst condemning that kind of behaviour, unionists argue that Alliance bears responsibility for its own decisions in limiting the flying of the Union flag over Belfast City Hall. Now Gavin Robinson, a namesake but not a relation of the DUP leader, has high hopes of winning East Belfast back for unionism. The man with the barking dog might not like the pact, but others I talked to on the streets of East Belfast think unionists should have been co-operating long ago. Gavin Robinson insists the pact has been broadly welcomed. But Naomi Long claims it has galvanised some Ulster Unionists to back her rather than let their choices be dictated by the unionist leaders. Four others are competing for votes in East Belfast. They are Sinn Fein's Niall \u00c3\u201c Donnghaile, the SDLP's Mary Muldoon, the Greens' Ross Brown and the Conservative Neil Wilson. But it's the DUP Alliance battle which is box office - something underlined by the large audience which packed out the Strand Cinema in East Belfast to watch the two frontrunners go head to head. The Slugger O'Toole election debate wasn't quite the thriller some might have hoped for. Both Naomi Long and Gavin Robinson were at pains to reject suggestions they can't stand each other. Gavin Robinson also distanced himself from remarks by his party leader that Ms Long she should \"dry her eyes\" rather than complaining about the unionist pact. The candidates differed about issues like the extent of paramilitary racketeering or the impact a future withdrawal from the European Union might have on the local aircraft industry. Afterwards both sides claimed victory. The audience were then ushered out to make way for the cinema's late showing \"Fast and Furious 7\", a title which could be adopted for the closely fought and sometimes heated contest in East Belfast.",

The film kick-started her Hollywood career, and the relationship with Miramax boss Harvey Weinstein brought Dame Judi her only Oscar to date, for an eight-minute cameo as Queen Elizabeth in the 1998 movie Shakespeare in Love. She has since received Academy nominations for roles in Chocolat, Iris, Mrs Henderson Presents, Notes on a Scandal and, this year, for Philomena.

Researchers interviewed former prisoners, defectors, forensic experts and families of the disappeared. Syria's government and its allies had questioned the images' authenticity. They were first published in January 2014 in a report by three former war crimes prosecutors that was commissioned by Qatar, which supports the political and armed opposition in Syria. In an interview earlier this year, President Bashar al-Assad said: \"You can bring photographs from anyone and say this is torture. There is no verification of any of this evidence, so it's all allegations without evidence.\" But on Wednesday, Human Rights Watch laid out in a new report what it said was new evidence regarding the authenticity of the Caesar photographs, identifying a number of the victims and highlighting some of the key causes of death. The US-based group said it had located and interviewed 33 relatives and friends of 27 victims whose cases researchers verified; 37 former detainees who saw people die in detention; and four defectors who worked in Syrian government detention centres or the military hospitals where most of the photographs were taken. Syria torture report In pictures: Syria accused of torture Using satellite imagery and geolocation techniques, HRW confirmed that some of the photographs of the dead were taken in the courtyard of the 601 Military Hospital in Mezzeh, a western suburb of the capital Damascus. The group also identified a coding system for the cards placed on the bodies. \"We have meticulously verified dozens of stories, and we are confident the Caesar photographs present authentic - and damning - evidence of crimes against humanity in Syria,\" said Nadim Houry, HRW's deputy Middle East director. HRW said its report focused on 28,707 of the 53,275 photos smuggled out of Syria by Caesar that, based on all available information, showed the bodies of at least 6,786 people who died in detention or after being transferred from detention to a military hospital. The remaining photographs are of attack sites or of bodies identified by name as of government soldiers, other combatants, or civilians killed in attacks, explosions or assassination attempts. Most of the victims were detained by just five intelligence agency branches in Damascus, and their bodies were sent to at least two military hospitals in Damascus between May 2011, when Caesar began copying files and smuggling them out of his workplace, and August 2013, when he fled Syria, HRW said. Forensic pathologists from Physicians for Human Rights analysed a subset of the photos, and found evidence of several types of torture, starvation, suffocation, violent blunt force trauma, and in one case, a gunshot wound to the head. Among the 27 victims identified by HRW - all of whose families spent months or years searching for news of their whereabouts, in many cases paying huge sums to contacts and middlemen - were Rehab al-Allawi, a boy who was 14 at the time of his arrest for having an anti-Assad song on his phone, and student Rehab al-Allawi, who was 25 when she was detained while working with an activist group. The former detainees, held in the same places as most of the victims, told HRW that guards kept them in severely overcrowded cells with very little air circulation, gave them so little food that they grew weak, and often denied them the opportunity to wash. Skin diseases and other infectious diseases proliferated, and the detainees said guards denied them adequate medical care. \"Many of the former detainees who were held in these nightmarish conditions told us they often wished they would die, rather than continue suffering,\" Mr Houry said.

They were convicted of firearms and drugs charges on Monday after a six-week trial. At Woolwich Crown Court they were given prison sentences ranging from six-and-a-half years to 14 years. Describing it as \"a carefully planned enterprise\" Judge Philip Shorrock said: \"The guns were intended for use by serious criminals. They would be used to kill or maim.\" The court heard the gang was caught after armed police stopped two of the men in two BMW cars arriving at Folkestone on Eurotunnel last year. Officers discovered five handguns and three silencers, while 500g of cocaine was found in an Army issue boot covered in duct tape and curry powder to disguise the smell. Detectives believe the guns were destined for criminal gangs in London. Ringleader Lemar Loveless, 26, of Brydon Walk, Islington, north London, who had resigned from the army in November 2011 and was on terminal leave, was jailed for 14 years after admitting conspiring to import firearms. Lance Laurent, 26, of Gloucester Street, Battersea, south-west London, was sentenced to 12 years in jail after admitting conspiring to import firearms. Both Loveless and Laurent were also found guilty of conspiring to import class A drugs. Trave Dyce, 22, of Sydney Road, Smethwick, West Midlands, was jailed for seven-and-a-half years after he admitted conspiring to import drugs and firearms. Romone Mashalleck, 25, a civilian, of Huron Street, Balham, south London, was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in jail after being found guilty of conspiring to import firearms. Duran Wright, a former regimental police officer in the Army, was jailed for 10 years. The 28-year-old, of Jerningham Road, New Cross, south-east London, was found guilty of conspiring to import class A drugs and firearms. Laurent had been a trooper with the Queen's Royal Hussars and Wright had been a lance corporal with the Royal Logistics Corps. Dyce and Loveless had been troopers in the Queen's Royal Hussars. They were all based in Germany. Marshalleck was their civilian contact in London. Jurors heard Dyce, Laurent and Wright were serving soldiers while Loveless was on terminal leave ahead of his discharge from the Army. Alison Saunders, of the CPS, said: \"This was a planned conspiracy to bring weapons, ammunition and drugs into the UK organised by four soldiers, based in Germany, and their civilian contact in London.\" She said the full extent of those involved was only discovered when phone data was \"meticulously analysed and a picture of those involved was created\". She continued: \"These deadly weapons could have gone on to be used in violent crimes. \"The high-purity cocaine that was imported had a street value of over \u00c2\u00a370,000 and would almost certainly have made big profits for criminal gangs while damaging lives.\"",

Next year, when the government brings in a compulsory National Living Wage across the United Kingdom, there will be no separate rate for London. The living wage is calculated according to the basic cost of living. The capital's voluntary living wage - which is not legally enforceable - is assessed by the Living Wage Foundation and economists at the Greater London Authority. Mayor Boris Johnson's office estimates 724 employers in London have now signed up. Those employers now have six months to implement the new pay level. National minimum wage: The current mandatory minimum is \u00a36.70 per hour for people aged 21 and over, and \u00a35.30 for those aged 18 to 20 National Living Wage: This will be mandatory from April 2016 for workers aged 25 and above. It will initially be set at \u00a37.20 an hour and is intended to exceed \u00a39 an hour by 2020 London living wage: A voluntary higher rate of the living wage in the capital, which will rise from \u00a39.15 to \u00a39.40 an hour. There are currently no plans to make this scheme mandatory Mr Johnson said the move would help \"pay the people who work hardest on lowest incomes decently\". While he is a prominent supporter of the voluntary London living wage, he has resisted calls to make it mandatory, saying small businesses \"would struggle with wage rigidity\". Labour's mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan called in-work poverty \"a shameful blight on our city\", adding: \"Neither the government nor the mayor are doing enough to turn things round.\" The Green Party highlighted disparity between the new recommended rate in London and the national minimum wage for Londoners aged 18 to 20, currently \u00a35.30 an hour.

The alien world could give us more information about the formation of our Solar System. The find was made by the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI), which looks for young planets orbiting bright nearby stars. Our own Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system - it's so big you could fit over 1,300 Earths inside it! It's also the fastest rotating planet too, with 1 day only lasting 10 hours - but a year on Jupiter lasts for 12 Earth years. Jupiter doesn't have a solid surface and is made up of gas, giving it the name 'gas giant'. The baby Jupiter has the strongest methane gas signature ever found on an alien planet. The astronomers also detected water using the GPI's spectrometer instrument. Scientists hope that by studying far away worlds, they can learn more about how common the structure of our Solar System is. Astronomers believe the gas giants in our Solar System formed slowly - by building up a large core over a few million years and then pulling in a huge amount of hydrogen and other gases to form an atmosphere. This is known as a \"cold-start\". But the Jupiter-like planets that have been discovered so far are much hotter than scientists have predicted. Which could mean they formed quickly - as gas collapses to make a scorching planet in what is known as a 'hot-start'.",
